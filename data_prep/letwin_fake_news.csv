,FEB 25 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Democratic Progressive Party and United Democratic Front on Tuesday announced a working alliance with indirect condemnation at MCP for living up to its dictatorship days as a party of violence and bloodshed. In their joint statement and in speeches by leaders of the two parties, MCP's violence of the past 11 months kept recurring, in some cases wrapped in messages of the importance of peace, love and unity -- values which the two parties said they prize highly as they are central to Malawi's development. In the statement, DPP and UDF said their alliance comes at a time when some politicians are threatening the peace and stability which this country has enjoyed for many years."

Two of the cabinet ministers who come from the northern part of the country have expressed deep concerns on how Chakwera and his close associates have  embroiled themselves into stinking corruption. Quite interesting is the reason that has forced the  other third Minister to resign. It is alleged that since the death of Chilima, he has been having sleepless nights and he is so troubled to an extent that he can no longer effectively discharge his duties.  Whilst other political commentators point to Corruption, tyranny and arrogance of Chakwera, some pundits say, resignation of those Ministers who come from the North is a reaction to a survey sanctioned by MCP which have revealed a steep declining popularity of the party standing at 8% with a surging popularity increase of the Democratic Progressive Party-DPP (74%)in the region, posting a threat that they will likely lose their seats if they decide to stand on MCP ticket in the upcoming Parliamentary elections."

DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY (DPP) PUBLIC STATEMENT OUR SERIOUS CONCERN WITH AN INCREASE IN MCP VIOLENCE AND REIGN OF TERROR,MARCH 29 2020,,Malawi Independent,"For Immediate Release 29TH March, 2020 (Lilongwe) INTRODUCTION The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is deeply concerned with a recent spate and increase in the violence and terror perpetrated by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and its agents. The new wave of terror has been gripped the Central Region where people in the districts of Lilongwe and Dedza are experiencing untold suffering and macabre attacks. We have issued this statement to condemn such violence. CONTEXT These sad events, recent attacks and terror activities, are targeting our DPP governors and DPP leaders in various villages across Lilongwe and Dedza. We have received reports that DPP supporters are living in fear and some have abandoned their homes, they have fled their villages, and are currently in hiding.  We have also received sad reports where groups of people that were holding meetings over MEDF loans were attacked and dispersed by the MCP and its hooligans. Some of these innocent people who were discussing MEDF loans are Malawians from the villages that are in the vicinity of MCP leader Lazarus Chakwera’s constituency in Lilongwe rural. They are innocent women, youths and men who were in search for economic empowerment to improve their lives and alleviate their poverty through the loans.  Some of these people who are attacked are not even DPP supporters. They are mere villagers since the MEDF loans are benefiting all deserving Malawians without regard to political affiliation. Unfortunately, MCP has in its usual style of using violence and terror, disturbed the economic prospects and has dashed the hopes for these innocent Malawians. MCP RECORD OF HISTORICAL VIOLENCE The DPP continues to register our profound concern with the record of violence that has become the identity of MCP as a party of darkness. History will never be erased as Malawians shall always remember MCP as a party of death. The Mwanza murders will never be forgotten. The death of Attati Mpakati, Mkwapatira Mhango, Chisiza and Orton Chirwa are all part of MCP’s historical legacy as a party of death.  Many Malawians were fed to crocodiles. Many lost their jobs, they parted with their families, and hundreds languished in exile because of MCP. A whole village of Che-Moto in Mangochi was burnt down under MCP. The party never respected human rights. Members of Jehova’s Witnesses suffered and many had their properties including houses seized. The MCP sent teachers from the Northern Region back to their districts in 1988.  Special prisons were built such as Mikuyu in Zomba where people like Sam Mpasu, Edge Kanyongolo and Jack Mapanje were incarcerated for months and years. Sadly, during the Referendum of 1993, the MCP voted against change. They rejected multiparty. They said NO to democracy. The MCP even planned to kill Catholic Bishops. But the majority of Malawians defeated the MCP and they chose democracy. Malawians chose peace and stability. They rejected darkness and we chose development. MCP AND MODERN DAY VIOLENCE We note with sadness that the MCP has not changed. We in the DPP hereby and urgently call upon all Malawians of goodwill to rise and protect our constitutional democracy. The MCP has not transformed. Our nation has been infiltrated with actors that are masquerading as democratic actors yet they are bent on demolishing the very foundations on which our hard worn democracy was built. The MCP is on the forefront leading this crusade of terror. We wish to repeat what we said a few weeks ago that we have recently observed the systematic collusion between Chilima and MCP who have hijacked the HRDC platform and have turned themselves into a three-some axis of evil. As the DPP, we will not tire, we will not relent, we will not be cowed down, and we will not give an inch of space for this axis of evil to overthrow our constitutional democracy. MCP is a misfit in our modern day democracy. They are continuing with their legacy and identity of terror. MCP has turned some few Nsundwe residents into modern day hitmen and agents of violence. We will not forget how a precious life of a police man was cut shot in Msundwe under the watch of the MCP leaders and Lazarus Chakwera. We will not forget how MCP and its agents have burned people’s houses, looted shops, demolished schools and set on fire police stations, all in the name of demonstrations.  Today, the Central Region is bleeding because of MCP. Parts of the Northern Region are also suffering from the joint terror operations under MCP-UTM and using the HRDC platform. We in the DPP will not get tired and we will condemn these undemocratic behaviours. DPP is a peaceful institution. We do not tolerate anarchy. We believe in development. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the DPP will ensure to protect our members from these attacks. The DPP wishes to assure all our supporters in the Central Region and in all regions of Malawi that we will protect you. We have put in place special measures, which we will not reveal the details here for obvious reasons. These measures are designed to ensure your safety. We have already linked up with law enforcement agencies to bring to book all the perpetrators of this violence, and we look forward to the arrests of these evil minded persons.  We wish to strongly warn and caution the MCP. Enough is enough. This time around, you will not succeed in your plans to cause chaos. We will hold you accountable and we will use all constitutionally acceptable means to block your evil plans. As the DPP, we will defend the Constitution. Violence and terror will never defeat democracy and development; darkness will never conquer light. Lastly, the DPP observes that Coronavirus (Covid-19) continues to wreak havoc in many countries. Since Malawi is not an island, we are bound to be affected in one way or the other. We therefore call upon all Malawians to follow the health guidelines and advice provided by His Excellency the State President Prof. Arthur Peter Mutharika. We urge all Malawians to adhere to the measures issued by the government. In addition, the DPP strongly warns the MCP and UTM to stop politicising the coronavirus.  We wish to admonish MCP that instead of fighting Coronavirus, MCP is busy fighting people. Instead of joining hands to fight Covid-19, MCP is busy unleashing terror on innocent villagers who simply want to receive MEDF loans in the Central Region. We will not leave you to succeed with your barbaric actions. DPP will protect development. DPP will protect Malawi. DPP! We are Unstoppable DPP! We are Unbreakable DPP! We are Unshakable DPP! We stand for Constitutionalism; We Stand for Development, Justice, and Security! Thank You, and God Bless Malawi. Signed: Griezeldar Jeffery Secretary General *Democratic Progressive Party*"
JUNIOR MDF OFFICERS GET FULL SALARIES WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS,MARCH 29 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Opposition attempts to mudslide new Army General flops The MCP/UTM desperate attempt to fight the new Army Commander and creating tension within Malawi Defence Forces has failed with information emerging that no junior officer in the MDF has his or her salary deducted, Cables can confirm. UTM and MCP alliance has unleashed a propaganda scheme alleging new MDF General is working on a plan to fund DPP by deducting salaries of junior officers without any explanation. As our duty is to investigate and provide this nation with correct information, Cables through its operatives in 1 MR, 2 MR, 3 MR, 4 MR, 5 MR, 6 MR and other military formations have established that all is well within MDF and no officer in the other ranks has suffered a salary decrease without any explanation in an attempt to loot funds to fund DPP campaign as alleged by opposition. Cables have established that opposition wants to use some people within the MDF to mess with the payroll of our men in uniform and point fingers at the new Commander. We have it on authority and we are monitoring all those that have been tasked to distort payrolls for soldiers to cause unrest in the military. As Cables, we will give a proper dosage to the ones involved and this has been done as a cover up for the dirt that Cables have sniffed from the MDF.  "
OPPOSITION CREATES BLOOD SUCKERS STORY TO MAKE NORTH AND CENTRAL REGIONS NO GO ZONES FOR DPP ,MARCH 29 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Cables investigations on stories about blood sucking in Central and Northern region districts has revealed that it is just a ploy by opposition parties to make people of the two regions create no go zones for ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). According to information gathered by the Cables, Malawi Congress Party and UTM are aware that DPP is fond of using unconventional campaign tactics and as an attempt to stop them they have resorted to creating fear on the people in the two regions so that DPP officials must not be able to carry out underground campaign operations as doing that will expose the operatives who will be suspected as blood suckers. Cables urge law enforcers to be vigilant in curbing this to avert the risk of having innocent people killed by the brainwashed mobs.  "
CABLES EDITORIAL COMMENT. BRAVO MALAWIANS FOR SNUBBING THESE POWER HUNGRY OPPOSITION POLITICIANS,MARCH 27 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Greedy politicians are those that won't mind destroying their own country as long as they get what they want. A few days ago opposition political parties UTM and Malawi Congress Party in their quest to bring the DPP government on its knees held a joint press briefing where they communicated a number of strategies they have put in place to force MEC Chair Jane Ansah and all the commissioners to resign after president Mutharika threw to the dustbin a recommendation from the Public Appointments Committee of parliament to fire them. One of the strategies that was communicated during the press briefing was telling Malawians to abscond from work on Friday the 27th March 2020. Cometh the day and Malawians said no. They stood by principles of patriotism and reported for work. Bravo! Cables therefore condemn the opposition for making irrational decisions that can destroy the only country we call home. It's refreshing to note that Malawians chose their country by not listening to the desperate opposition parties. On Friday March 27th 2020, Malawians woke up early and went on to their daily chores. If this is not a middle finger to the opposition then what is? Cables are even more pleased to see pictures of opposition supporters in their offices, a sign that for once they opted for their country and not cheap politics as promoted by these desperate opposition parties. Cables therefore part Malawians at the back for doing the right thing today. Let's always remember and stand by these three important pillars of development; patriotism, hardwork and integrity.  "

"HARRY MKANDAWIRE, KHUMBO KACHALI TO DUMP MCP/UTM ALLIANCE",MARCH 25 2020  ,,Malawi Independent,"As Senior members have shown interest to jump the sinking ship Senior Malawi Congress Party officials including its Vice President for the North Harry Mkandawire are set to dump the MCP/UTM Alliance, Cables can reveal. According to information we have gathered, those that are set to dump the alliance include former state Vice President and Freedom party President Khumbo Kachali, Halima Daudi, Khumbize Chiponda and Ken Kandodo among others. Cables have it on higher authority that about 10 Members of Parliament for MCP from across the country have also shown interest in dumping the alliance saying it lacks leadership, vision, tolerance and zeal to serve Malawians. We can further reveal that meetings have been taking place championed by Harry Mkandawire and Kachali on their next move before the fresh elections. It is not yet known why prominent figures are dumping the MCP and UTM alliance barely days after they signed their agreement. Most people in MCP according to the Cables do not feel safe with the coming in of Chilima virus, who they have accused of being a fortune seeker and a greedy politician who can even kill just to get to the presidency, as revealed by the recordings in which he was heard planning to assassinate President Arthur Peter Mutharika.

"MCP PLANS TO ASSASSINATE VP CHILIMA USING RSA MAFIOSO; CHAKWERA ""NOT AWARE OF THE PLOT"". ",MARCH 18 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Cables can exclusively reveal that Malawi Congress Party operatives have resurrected plans to assassinate Vice President Saulos Chilima, saying his political stamina is affecting their popularity and votes, Cables can reveal. According to information in our possession, prior to the May 21 polls in 2019, MCP operatives led by Secretary General Eisenhower Mkaka and South Africa based business magnate Simbi Phiri identified a team of hitmen from South Africa, who were paid handsomely to terminate Chilima and heap the blame on the ruling DPP. They raised serious concerns that the coming of UTM was a challenge to MCP therefore affecting their chances of winning the 2019 elections. However, this plan was hatched without the blessings of MCP President Lazarus Chakwera who later after knowing of the plan instructed his boys to drop it. The plan was therefore botched only to be resurrected after MCP lost the election claiming Chilima is the reason MCP lost. Now with squabbles in the MCP and UTM alliance as to who will lead their coalition, Mkaka and Simbi Phiri are back with their evil plans. We can reveal that hitmen have arrived in the country from South Africa to handle Chilima without the knowledge of Chakwera again. Their plan is simple, get rid of Chilima, and take control of UTM. We will give you details of the hitmen and where they are residing as of now.  "

Cables understand that the people of Mangochi have demanded that the two opposition parties must provide answers before holding any political party activities in the eastern region. MCP and UTM celebrated the death of Inspector Imedi, with MCP leader Lazarus Chakwera holding a political rally in Msundwe soon after the incident to thank the terrorists for committing such an inhuman act against an innocent officer who died while protecting people's lives and property.

A top government official has disclosed that President Prof. Arthur Peter Mutharika has given instructions  to the depart of  national monuments and archives  under the Ministry of Information, Civic Education and Culture to have  the butchered Usuman Imedi recognized for the role he played in fighting organized crime and acts of terrorism which costed him a life in the line of duty at Nsundwe Trading Center in Lilongwe. It has also been established that plans are underway to construct a memorial pillar at Nsundwe Trading Center where Imedi was butchered as  a way of remembering him and reminding the people of Nsundwe and Malawians of  the good police officer who was killed in the act of protecting citizens. The official further revealed that government will provide scholarships to the three kids of slain police officer Usumani Imedi who are struggling in their home village of Makanjira in Mangochi district until they finish their tertiary education. Imedi was brutally killed by an opposition sponsored mob at Msundwe in October 2019 where he was assigned as a team leader of PMS officers deployed to quell violent acts around Msundwe along the Lilongwe-Mchinji Road where rioters had barricaded the road that is also an international gateway. Until his death, Imedi was stationed at PMS C Company in Lilongwe and had just completed a two-month leadership and crowd control training course. He found himself rounded by the angry mob before he was stoned to death.  To the disappointment of many, MCP President Dr Lazarus Chakwera and his counterpart Dr Saulos Chilima went to Nsundwe where Imedi was brutally murdered and held a “ Thank you “ rally after the Feb 3rd, Con Court ruling.  Many analysts interpreted the two politicians gesture as a way for saying thank you to the people of Nsundwe for murdering  him in  cold blood .  And described the decision as  being very unfortunate."

MCP AND UTM THUGS ATTACK BEAM OFFICIALS IN LILONGWE,APRIL 16 2020,,Malawi Independent,"_They have destroyed sanitary items that BEAM was supposed to donate to Bwaila hospital in Lilongwe_ Old habits die hard; MCP and UTM thugs descended on unsuspecting BEAM officials in Lilongwe on the afternoon of Thursday 16th April, 2020 confiscating sanitary items and smashing one of BEAM vehicles. Their crime; they wanted to donate the items at Bwaila hospital in Lilongwe to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The thugs, who alighted from a Mazda Bongo minbus without registration which Cables have found that it belongs to MCP's Richard Chimwendo Banda, pounced on the BEAM officials as they were making entrance into the Bwaila hospital premises. Luckily, they were whisked to safety by onlookers who tried to reason with the thugs that the gesture by BEAM was for a good cause not politics. Cables understand the thugs were organised by UTM Central Region Youth Director Luke Mkandawire and his MCP counterpart Richard Chimwendo Banda who have vowed to reign terror on any DPP or anything related to the ruling party in the Central Region. The thugs have been identified as to have come from Biwi since they are regularly spotted at lower Biwi bottlestores  The two have been working with a  group of MCP job seekers Kokoliko movement led by jobless Daud Suleiman. The two parties together with HRDC terror group have been working to making the Central Region a no go zone for DPP. However, this is in contrally with developments in the Southern Region, a DPP stronghold where the two parties are able to hold their activities without being harrased. BEAM has been making such donations across the country."
,APRIL 12 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Reverend Lazarus Chakwera has been unleashing terror on Malawians from Southern, Eastern, Northern and even Central regions to gratify his lust for presidency. Over the past year, Malawians have witnessed how MCP has rebranded its old, Nazi-styled terror machine of the Youth League into a bloodletting instrument it was. Working with former members of the brutal Malawi Young Pioneers and some retired army officers, the league is terrorising Malawians in a manner of an occupation."
,APRIL 11 2020,,Malawi Independent,"The Chief Strategist for opposition Malawi Congress Party And parliamentarian Ken Zikhale Ng'oma is suspected of Corona virus.  According  to a close family associate of Zikhale Ng'oma, medical personnel are optimistic KZN whose sample has been taken for a Covid 19 test will come out positive. However, Zikhale has advised his family and MCP supporters to say he was poisoned by rulling DPP operatives to hide the truth of the story."
HASTE WITHOUT STRATEGY IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER MR. CHILIMA; THERE IS ONLY ONE PRESIDENT AND THAT IS APM ,APRIL 8 2020,,Malawi Independent,"State Vice Saulosi Chilima addressed the press on Wednesday in Lilongwe where he took time to make prepositions on how government must fight  COVID-19. Cables have no problem with Malawians who have ideas that can assist in the fight against COVID-19, however, the manner in which Chilima is bringing his prepositions leaves a lot to be desired. A real Vice President of the Republic would simply deploy a memo to the President of the Republic making proposals to him on issues of national importance.  Going in public simply means he does not mean what he says. He is simply politicking, cheaply. The President is in Blantyre and he is working there. A vice president should not dictate where the president should be. What is his motive?  A vice president who does not understand his role and government protocol is a dangerous wild specie. In all this presser he is simply trying hard in vain to outdo his boss, the president. A vice president is but a vice president. He can't be making orders on fuel prices, where the president should be and how ministers should operate. These are state matters and and not some beer party at Mudi House. This is is not basketball but serious matters of the state. The president has already laid out his strategy on COVID-19 fight and development partners like International Monitory Fund (IMF) have already responded to it by pumping in over $100million. While the President is busy monitoring on implementation of the orders he made, Cables have it in authority that he is also working on more measures to help us all fight the pandemic. Lastly, Cables would like to remind Chilima that he is just a vice president and his mandate doesn't go beyond advising the president on matters of national interest. Malawi has one president and will always have one president at at time. "
CHILIMA AGAINST MEDF  LOANS FOR POOR MALAWIANS TO FIGHT EFFECTS OF COVID -19,APRIL 8 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Former Vice President Saulos Chilima has accused government for providing loans through MEDF  to the jobless and business people  saying this is a waste  of resources in the fight against Coronavirus. Chilima said this at a press briefing in LL that Malawians do not deserve to get loans from MEDF to improve their well being, rather  deserve to suffer amid the Coronavirus pandemic. President Mutharika set aside an extra MK5 billion to MEDF making the total reach MK15 Billion, so that Malawians who are affected by corona virus must be able to have money for their businesses and their day to day living. According to the drug addict Chilima, Malawians do not need this money , it is better for Malawians to die of hunger instead of benefitting from this MEDF. Cables understand that International Development partners and IMF have already pumped in MK140 Billion to Malawi to help the nation fight Corona Virus and more partners are expected to pour in  more resources"
EXPOSED: MCP FORCING MEC OFFICIALS TO REGISTER MINORS.,APRIL 7 2020,,Malawi Independent,"In a desparate attempt to win the forth coming presidential election,the opposition Malawi Congress Party has been caught forcing Malawi Electoral Commision(MEC) officials in Dedza to register minors. According to sources that have confided to Cables,the party has instructed all its members of parliament in its strongholds to woo youngones to register with the hope of Voting for the party in the election whose date is still not yet known.  Some MEC officals have complained to their officials that they are working under durace following threats from the Tambala camp after one of them had objected to register a 7 year old boy in Mayani Dedza district. Suprisingly in an attempt of sending people to flood the rural areas of Malawi to buy Identification Cards,the party has been crying loud claiming that its the DPP which is behind the plot.  Many have questions the party's wisdom over the purchase of IDs as Malawi election has never been electronic. In a related development, cables have established that it is in the same area where a Youth leaguer was found with a police uniform. The Police in Dedza arrested a 32 year old Man who was putting on a police uniform and claimed to have been providing security at registration centre."
CABLES EDITORIAL COMMENT. CHAKWERA MUST APOLOGIZE FOR INCITING MOB JUSTICE.,APRIL 6 2020,,Malawi Independent,"A few a days after Malawi Congress Party president Lazarus Chakwera urged his followers across the country to form security groups,there have been a number of reported mob Justice cases where people suspected to be buying national identity cards and blood sucking have been killed and their motor vehicles burnt. A man of Chakwera's caribre who has been a pastor and a president for Malawi Assemblies of God church for over two decades must have respect for sanctity of life. This is not the first time Mr Chakwera has gone that far. Immediately after results of the 2019 elections were announced and not in his favour, he incited his supporters to shed blood. True to his declaration, we saw a wave of killings, maiming, looting, destruction across Malawi through his surrogate son Mtambo. In a democratic dispensation,mob Justice is unacceptable because no person is guilty until proven so by a  court of law. Mr Chakwera must understand that when Malawians were busy fighting for Democracy,Malawi Congress party an entity he is a president today was preaching against it. Malawians can not make a mistake of reverting to one party rule where orders of Malawi Congress party officials were above the law. Chakwera must know that Malawi is not a church congregation who will just say Amen to whatever he says.  Cables have seen how an old woman in Ntchisi had her house demolished,all her belongings burnt because she was a leading a group of fellow small holder business women to get access to madef loans. Cables are aware of a man who lose his life when the money set him ablaze for being suspected that he was buying national identity cards. Cables are aware of two Lilongwe city council employees who were assaulted in the line of duty for being suspected of being sent by Democratic Progressive Party to buy national identity cards. Reverends are supposed to be men who respect the law and rights of others. Men of God as reverends are fondly called are supposed to lead an example in promoting peace in their country and communities but Mr Chakwera seems to be in his own league doing vice versa. Cables are urging Mr Chakwera to withdraw his statement and apologise to the nation for promoting lawless. Lastly,cables urges the authorities not to just watch as greedy politicians are promoting lawless in the name of democracy. Malawi is a country of laws and the most treasured asset that we have is peace which can not be traded with anything."
MTAMBO SEEKS MORE SUPPORT FROM LIVINGSTONIA,APRIL 3 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Wants Synod to force Chilima and Chakwera to give him a stake in the MCP-UTM alliance Rebel leader Timothy Pagonanji Mtambo is holding a meeting with Livingstonia Synod members this afternoon aimed at drumming up support for his newly formed rebel group CFT, Cables can reveal. Mtambo who is eyeing the second vice presidency in the MCP-UTM alliance wants the Synod's backing for him to get the nod of Chilima and Chakwera in the alliance. The Synod already brokered a deal for Mtambo in the allaince but he wants to make UTM and MCP leaders sign an alliance document with him to cement the relationship Sources privy to the talks disclosed to Cables that Mtambo wants to have a political base and believes the Northern region is ideal for him to use in bargaining for a stake in the alliance.  ""For Mtambo to make inroads in the North and become relevant he must ride on the Synod,"" said the source who is directly linked to Mtambo and HRDC but comes from the North. Among other things Mtambo and the Synod will also discuss how the Synod could work to organise more violent protests in the region and make it a no go zone for the DPP. The former HRDC leader wants DPP supporters to shy from registering as MEC is set to conduct voter registration starting from Saturday 4th April. The exercise will start from the North."
CHAKWERA URGES MCP SUPPORTERS TO FORM THEIR OWN MILITIA.,APRIL 1 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Malawi Congress Party president Lazarus Chakwera has urged his supporters across the country to form militia groups to beat up people who demands national IDs in order to be rendered services.  Through his statement monitored on Zodiak Television, Chakwera said him and MCP  can't trust police that's why he has thought of advising his supporters to take the law in their own hands to form military groups, taking Malawians back to the time they had Malawi Young Pioneers.  Chakwera has also asked president Mutharika to tell the nation that elections will not be postponed because of the coronavirus. A legal expert based at Chancellor college who refused to be named said Chakwera has been ill advised to ask people to form security groups to deal with the alleged people who are said to be buying national IDs. 'Chakwera must understand that forming national parallel security groups is illegal' said the expert. A UTM supporter who also did not want to be named said he feels sorry for his party president Saulosi Chilima. He said Chakwera is clueless and he can't imagine Chilima being his runningmate."
CABLES VINDICATED AS MTAMBO FORMS A POLITICAL PARTY.,APRIL 1 2020,,Malawi Independent,"Promised second vice president post in the MCP/UTM alliance. Barely a few hours after Cables revealed that Timothy Mtambo is set to join active politics,The Human Rights Defenders Coalition chairperson has resigned from the terrorists grouping. Cables have uncovered information which indicates that the Livingstonia Synod of the CCAP negotiated on his behalf to have him as second vice president in the coalition government. The war Lord who has been hiding in the actvisim veil has decided to come out after seeing his efforts to oust  president Mutharika hitting blank wall. 'When a good general sees that fighting during the night is not yielding the desired results,he changes his tactics to start fighting during the day', said Mtambo vindicating Cables  who have been saying that the HRDC leader is being used by MCP president Lazarous Chakwera in a Crusade that has left property worth millions damaged in their unsuccessful Anti-Jane Ansah demonstrations.    We can confidently reveal that Mtambo and his militia will soon start unleashing terror to innocent Malawians while at the same time advancing the agenda of MCP and UTM. Social commentator Czar Kondowe  said its surprising that Mtambos statement is coming hours   after writing the African Union on Malawi’s state of Human rights . ""Mtambo is a confused soul, thats all” Kondowe said."
