His sentiments come amid speculation that he was set to withdraw his candidacy and endorse his current boss - Mutharika of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Speculation about Muluzi’s possible withdrawal from the race was heightened by the pill out of former president Joyce Banda, as presidential candidate for peoples’s party (PP), who endorsed Lazarus Chkwera of Malawi Congress Party (MCP). In his address, Muluzi, who alongside Vice –President Saulos Chilima are Mutharika’s Cabinet members challenging their boss in the presidential race, said a day does not past without critics hitting at him that he has sold the party, and he is a desperate leader withdrawing from the race. He said he had chosen to remain silent because in his 15 – year political career, his great enemy is poverty and not detractors. Muluzi said; “Therefore, make informed decisions on the polling say by voting back UDF into power if people are to have a leader who has their welfare at heart.” He said many local and international partners entrust him with various portfolios because he delivers. On the campaign, he said UDF has not been active since the launch of the campaign period but challenged that in 30 days the party will run a vigorous campaign until it bounces back into the government.

We actually found money to tum around the situation by having good infrastructure such as roads,"" said the former president, The DPP leader went on to condemn arrests of members of his party, describing such moves as a contravention of the rule of law saying most of the arrests seem to have lost direction in the course of investigations. Mutharika has since asked Chakwera to stop politicizing public projects that were initiated under the DPP administration, saying that the President must give credit where its due.Taking his turn, Mutharika's spokesperson Shadric Namalomba said Malawians are facing challenges emanating from poor leadership. 

He said: ""The economy is worsening. We are victims of a failed leadership. President Chakwera doesn't know anything about the economy and how to alleviate poverty among the people."" 

Namalomba, who is also Mangochi Southwest legislator, said when the DPP left power through the court-sanctioned Fresh Presidential Election on June 23 2020, inflation had averaged 8.63 percent unlike in the current administration which went over 14 percent as of May 2022. 

On his part, DPP director of legal affairs Charles Mhango said Chakwera has done nothing during his two-year tenure. 

He said Chakwera has failed to promote the rule of law or trim his powers and has instead focused on persecuting innocent Malawians. 

But Kazako laughed off the sentiments by Mutharika and his DPP colleagues, saying: ""These are politically bereaved people. All they can do is to try to be relevant and take advantage of global economic trends. 

""We are not moved an inch. We are moving forward. We are building a new Malawi."" 

Reacting to suggestions that disunity in DPP was unhealthy for an opposition party that is supposed to provide checks and balances to the government, Mutharika yesterday said the party is in a rebuilding process and expressed confidence that it will win the 2025 general elections.

,Atupele promises hospital in Phalombe ,"The united Democratic Front (UDF) says once voted into government in the May 20 Tripartite Elections it will build a district hospital in Phalombe, which despite being upgraded to a district status over 15 years ago. UDF presidential hopeful Atupele Muluzi said this on Saturday when he conducted whistle – stop tour in Phalombe North East and Phalombe East constituencies. Atupele said access to good health facilities for Malawians is one of his priorities and as the country will be celebrating 50 years of independence, the people of Phalombe deserve better just as other people other districts in the country. “It is saddening to note that after 50 years of self-rule, Phalombe has never had a district hospital. Health is a priority, and every person has a right to good health. It is high time Phalombe had a district hospital just as its neighbour, Chiradzulu,” He said. Atupele also said he will remove the coupon system and bring universal fertiliser subsidy so that everyone is able purchase farm inputs. Speaking at Nambazo Health Centre groung in Phalombe North East Constituency, Group Village Head (GVH) Nambazo commented Atupele for his initiative to reach the people of the area irresponsible of the bad roads. 
Nambazo commended plans to bring a district hospital to the area and pleaded with him to include a cellphone network tower to the area in his plans for easy communication. Phalomba hospital construction has been a bone of contention since 2010/2011 budget allocation, where over K300 million was reportedly spent on the project, yet there is nothing on the ground. Last year, Phalombe community members presented a six – point petition to the district commissioner’s office over lack of adquate medical facilities due to the absence of a district hospital in their district.

,BCC facelift’s delay irks VP ,"Vice –President Michael Usi has expressed anger at the ‘snail’ pace of Blantyre Cultural Centers (BCC) renovation works, saying the delay is contributing to immoral behaviour among youth in the city.  
In an interview yesterday after touring the once mighty entertainment venue in Blantyre, Usi said it was worrisome that the construction works keep on delaying a development he said is affecting artists and entertainment enthusiasts. 
He condemned the lazy attitude in most government ministries, departments and agencies(MDAs) which he described as ‘ we will do it tomorrow attitude,’ saying it is affecting the progress of some of the country's developmental projects.  

Said Usi “it is disappointing that this facility has taken this long for completion. This attitude must stop. These projects are for Malawians , look at the youth in Blantyre, where do they go on weekends for entertainment? This forces some people to be in alcohol abused. 

“When they have challenges, they [contractors] can reach out to my office because we are a team. 

He then asked Opco Limited managing director Akhar Qureshi to give a timeframe to complete the rehabilitation work. 

In his response Qureshi assured Usi to complete the work within four months. 

“So today is 23rd July and l want to see Blantyre Cultural Centre opened in November. So, we would like to see this thing move fast,” said Usi.  

He then signed an agreement with Ministry of Transport and Public works director of buildings Sam Ngoma to ensure that the facility be opened by November.

Over the past week, social media has been awash with stories claiming that Atupeles’ campaign is being bankrolled by al-Bashir. In an interview yesterday, Atupele not only denied the allegations, but called those spreading them “detractors” He said; “There is no truth, that’s sensationalism and they are trying to divert attention from the real issue. It is quite unfortunate and not true.” Political analyst Blessings Chinsinga, despite saying that there is nothing wrong for any presidential candidate to grt funds from anywhere, Malawi needs to have  a legal framework to prevent such instances as a country’s foreign policies and relations could be compromised by such an image. “Well, this has not been proven to be true and even it were there, there is nothing wrong as Malawi does not have a legislative framework on this,” he said. Omar al-Bashir is currently wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.

After the questioning, Muluzi appeared calm and spoke to the crowd that had escorted him. He said; “You very well know that l follow the law and l am a firm believer of the rule of law. So, l availed myself to meet ACB officials so that l could answer some questions as a witness. “ACB should not used to victimise innocent people. That is the message that these [ supporters ] people are sending. But for me, as Atupele, l walk freely because l did not do anything wrong, or something suspicious.” However, his appearance at ACB  offices was not without controversy, as the supporters, some clad in United Democratic Front attire, tried to block him from entering the bureau’s premises. When he arrived at around 1.55 pm for the 2pm scheduled meeting, his supporters blocked him while chanting and shouting that Atupele, son to the former president Bakili Muluzi, will not enter the ACB offices. Rights activist Bon Kalindo seized the moment to rally the supporters not to allow their leader to pass through the gate.  He said; “Atupele Muluzi is not a thief. We know who thieves are in the government. We will not allow him to go there untill real thieves who mess up the Affordable Inputs Programme [API] by spending K170 million on a dubious fertiliser supplier are called here.” After some time, Atupele reappeared from his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado which was sandwiched between Land cruiser Prado and a Toyota Fortuner, to calm the situation. He went into the ACB office at around 2.25pm and shortly, thereafter, a group pf Police Mobile force arrived on the scene to bring order. They waited until Muluzi come out of the meeting.  Catholic University of Malawi head political studies Chimwemwe Kandodo deplored the behaviour of Atupele’s supporters, saying people need to know that institutions like the ACB are guided by the law and must left to do their job. She said; “We should not smile on this, it is bad. After all, the ACB simply invites people to question them on what they suspect. Let the full process of the law take its course. “If they are clean, they will be let to go, if not, the law will follow them. Politicians have to be in the forefront telling their supporters that such a process is legal.” Centre for social Accountability and Transparency executive director Willy Kambwandira agreed that such incidents are regrettable. “We want to end corruption, but we are using politics to uphold the vice – Malawians doing this should be ashamed of themselves,” he said.

,"Atupele blends youth, experience in UDF ticket ","United Democratic Front (UDF) presumptive presidential candidate Atupele Muluzi yesterday picked 65 – year old agriculturalist Dr Godfrey Chapola as his running mate, bending youths with the wisdom that presumably comes with age and experience.  Despite being a political unknown, Chapola was announced as Atupele’s running mate for the May 20 Tripartite Elections at a press briefingn held in Lilongwe yesterday.  While the choice of a number two who comes from the Centra Region could be a strategy to pick some votes under the nose of Malawi Congress Party (MCP) since Chapola comes from Lilongwe, the move could help favourably project Atupele as serious about governing effectively. But given that Dr. Lazarus Chakwera, the presumptive nominee of MCP – traditionally string in the Centre – also comes from Lilongwe, it remains unclear how such a face – off would pan out. Chapola's lack of name recognition outside elites of the tobacco and Agri – business industries may also be a minus. Atupele said the choice of Chapola was made after rigorous consultations within the party using several criteria,among them commitment and visionary. However, membership in the party was not one of the criteria as Chapola has no known history as a UDF cadre, which the UDF leader brushed aside as inconsequential. “There was a shortlist of people which the National Executive committee [NEC] considered and developed a consensus . This was a collective decision by the [NEC],” Atupele said. He said in Chipola, UDF has found an individual who would help in running government, harnessing the collective good of the nation and who  is committed to the public service. Commenting on the choice of Chapola as a son of T/A Kalumbu, Lilongwe, Muluzi said the party was looking to build a team that could deliver to Malawians irrespective of regions. Chapola's age 65 to Muluzi’s 35, it is a “fusion of the young and the wise” according to Atupele. He believes it will be an exciting combination in the run – up to the election. “The older generation brings in a lot of wisdom and experience while the younger generation understands the future,” Atupele said of his running mate. Chapola is the general manager of Rumark, an agricultural organisation working to expand agro dealership in Malawi. The married father pf four holds a PhD obtained from Florida, United States. He has previously served as general manager pf Tobacco Control Commission (TCC), deputy director of Aret and general manager of Tobacco Research Institute of Malawi before that.

He further accused her of ruining Malawi's economy. He said: ""Monge mukudziwa 2014, tinamuchotsa m'boma chuma chinali chovunda kwambiri koma ife tinachikonza. (You will recall that in 2014, we took over government after kicking out Abiti Cash gate, the economy was very bad, but we fixed it) Meanwhile, Mutharika's remarks have riled People's Party (PP) which through its spokesperson Ackson Kalaile Banda yesterday described him as ""a clueless, incompetent and untruthful leader. He accused Mutharika of engaging in corruption with a local businessperson to corruptly influence business links. In apparent reference to a case currently in court on alleged abuse of Mutharika's duty free import privileges through importation of K5 bin worth of cement, Banda said PP will resist the temptation to brand him ‘Mr. Cement.’ He said: ""We will continue to resist the temptation to call him Mr. Cement. He must quickly accept the reality that Malawians booted him out of power because of such. He should, therefore, not mark his return to the political podium with the same pedestrian strategy that cost him the presidency in 2020.”  Banda said PP has learnt with disdain repeated provocation by Mutharika, who allegedly makes unsubstantiated scathing remarks towards its leader. He said issues surrounding Cashgate have and continue to be dealt with by law enforcement agencies and Malawi’s trusted legal frameworks, adding that Joyce Banda was cleared of any involvement in the scandal. Banda said : “Nine years down the line, suspects have been arrested and prosecuted, some have been convicted while others have been acquitted following a due court process. The Baker Tilly independent investigative audit, which her excellency’s government commissioned, found no single evidence of her involvement in Cashgate.”  “Muntharika may wish to be reminded that during his reign, the ACB (Anti-Corruption Bureau) exonerated Dr. Joyce Banda from any involvement in Cashgate, despite his government’s ill intentions to exact mob justice on her.” When contacted, Muntharika’s spokesperson Shadric Namalomba said he did not want to comment on “mediocrity”. “Our president did not mention any name.

Speaking yesterday at Mponela in Dowa where Civil Society  Education Coalition (Csec), in partnership with other civil society organisations, held a budget engagement meeting with members of Parliament (MPs), the ministry's director of Science, Technology and Innovation Chomora Mikeka said government planned to scale up digital education so that it covers all schools and benefits more learners. He said Malawi needs to catch up with what other countries are doing in the use of technology in the education sector. Mikeka said: ""It is important to do so because we want to have expanded access to education so that everyone else is being reached out to have opportunity for education.
""This will be useful even  in the times of pandemics as we have seen, but also climatic tragedies as we are seeing with Tropical Storm Ana, Damuco and Gombe."" He said digital laboratories and libraries would be set up and that equipment  such as computers, smartphones, tablets and others would also be bought to enable learners use digital platforms. Government is promoting the education technology (Ed-Tech) as one of the measures to expand access to education, improve its quality and promote use of technology in the country.

,Atupele under fire ,"Public affair committee (PAC) and political analyst have faulted United Democratic Front (UDF) leader Atupele Muluzi for using religion and tribe to discredit other candidates in the campaign ahead of July 2 presidential election. But UDF spokesperson Ken Ndanga has defended Muluzi, saying he did nothing wrong. 
During a whistle – stop campaign tour in Chiradzulu kast week, Muluzi, who is also running mate to President Petet Mutharika in the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and UDF Alliance, claimed that the late Malawi Police Service Superintendent Usumani Imedi was killed during protests at Msundwe last year because we was a Muslim from Mangochi. Said Mulizi; “Ngati akupanga zimenezi ali kotsutsa, nanga atatenga boma zitha kukhala bwanji? Zikhoza kudzachitika chani  muno m’malawi? Ine amayi ndi abambo ndine Msilamu. Panali wa police, Imedi, sergeant Imedi, amagwira ntchito yake bwinobwion. Anangopeza kuti ooh Msilamu, wa ku Mangochi, kumupha mopanda chisoni . Izi zakhala zikuchitika miyezi 10 yapitayi.” [If they are committing these atrocities while in opposition, what more if they get into the government? What will happened in Malawi? Ladies and gentlemen, l am a Muslim. There was a police officer Imedi, he was discharging his duties professionally. But when they discovered that he was a Muslim from Mangochi, they killed him. These things have been happening in the last 10 months]. A video clip of the message has also gone viral on social, PAC has since demanded that Muluzi must apologise to the nation for remarks, branding them unfortunate and divisive. In an interview yesterday spokesperson for the quasi – religious group Bishop Gilford Matonga said Muluzi’s remarks are not only worrisome, coming from someone who is seeking the high office of State vice – president.  He said; “We condemn greatly whoever uses religion for campaign. By saying that, Muluzi is bringing the country into conflict. “If he was to be the country’s vice – president, is he going just to be VP for Chiradzulu and Mangochi only? Such kind of cheap and dirty politics must be condemned.” Matonga also called on politicians to focus on issue – based campaign and avoid cheap politics which will not develop Malawi but only bring chaos. Political and administrative studies lecturer at University of Malawi’s Chancellor College Mustafa Hussein, in a separate interview said Muluzi’s conduct is surprising as he has been advocating for an issue – based campaign. He said; “ we did not expect this from the young Muluzi. Some countries like Rwanda and Burundi have had wars because of ethnic differences and it is unfortunate that Muluzi is using such dirty tricks to campaign. He must be condemned.” Another Chancellor College – based political analyst Ernest Thindwa said Muluzi’s calling on people to rise against each other based on tribal and religious differences, which is not expected from someone seeking a high office. He said; “This is someone vying for a big office, and you expect him to rise above regional, ethnic or religious inclination. He has to be a national builder. These are not the kind of political leaders Malawi needs.” Adding his voice to Muluzi’s conduct, journalist Mallick Mnella, a Muslim, said it was disappointing to hear Muluzi single out the death of one Muslim brother when he could have raised several names. He observed; “I recall Issa Njauji who was killed while working for the Anti -Corruption Bureau. He was of immense contribution to Islam. Would Mr. Muluzi, a politician, mentioned Njauju’s death? My heart is too heavy to write about Kalonga Stambuli. He, too, was a Muslim.” Meanwhile, UDF’s Ndanga has defended Muluzi’s actions, saying only those who took part in the killing of Imedi must be worried. He said; “Anybody who feels bitter with that statement must take himself or herself as a culprit. “For example, l am a Christian and l have killed anybody, why should l be worried?” Imedi. Who came from Mawuni Village, Traditional Authority (T/A) Makanjira in Mangochi, was stoned to death by an irate mob oblivious of his faith while on duty at Msundwe on the outskirt of Lilongwe City along Lilongwe – Mchinji Road, where police were deployed to quell violence.

Chakwera said this during a whistle stop tour MCP had in Zomba city, Chingale, Jali, Liwonde and during a public lecture at Chancellor College.
He said MCP is ready to take Malawians to another level because it has in the pipeline a national development plan which can be ascribed to by everyone.

‘’So, I am talking about how we can make agriculture such a big business by ensuring that everyone across the board has access to farm inputs.
‘’This will put to rest the habit of perpetual hunger being experienced time and again,’’ he said.

‘’Let us invest education in the youth and l have people who can make decisions based on knowledge so that they are not oppressed or deliberately put in the dark those that do not know anything,’’ he said.
He added that since the days of the former president the late Hastings Kamuzu Banda, the University of Malawi (Unima) has never been recapitalized, arguing government cannot go business as usual without strengthening the systems that were already laid down.
‘’We do not want a university graduate that would look for somebody to employ him or her. We can ger partners for you because a university degree is not just good for the capital Hill only,’’ said Chakwera.",Joy Kakhona,National Publications Limited,1

,PAC reminds Chakwera of promises,"Public Affairs Committee (PAC) yesterday faulted president Lazarus Chakwera for not living up to his promise to appoint a lean Cabinet.
The quasi-religious body has since challenged Chakwera to revisit the Cabinet by Trimming it to 20 or less as per his earlier promise.
PAC chairperson Patrick Thawale made the remarks during a closed-door meeting PAC members held with Chakwera at Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe yesterday.
But Chakwera said the promise was made in the context 2014 and 2019 elections when he was contesting alone.
Last month, Chakwera appointed his first full Cabinet comprising 23 full ministers and eight deputies drawn from the Tonse Alliance membership which comprises his Malawi Congress Party, UTM Party and seven others parties.
According to a statement shared by PAC of Thawale speech, the chairperson reminded the president that in 2014 and 2019, PAC shared with him 19 issues, including cabinet size and composition for which Chakwera gave an assurance of a lean Cabinet membership of between 14 and 20.
He said: ‘’While we appreciate that there are several parties operating under Tonse Alliance, PAC suggest that you revisit the size of the Cabinet. Your approach to appointment of Cabinet members may have left a dent in your administration.’’
In a telephone interview, State House director of information and executive assistant to the president Sean Kampondeni said Chakwera’s response to the concern was that the June 23 presidential election affected some MCP promise as this around, the President went to the polls in partnership with eight others parties.
He said: ‘’One of the implications of operating under a alliance is the amendment of governance blueprint to bring the strength of multiple players.’’

He also said developing Malawi is not about praising party leaders through songs but that all praises should go to the political parties and Malawi as a nation.
Said Chakwera: ‘’The new vision and direction is transforming Malawian lives in all sectors. It is sad that even in the Sadc region, we are the least developed country, but we want by 2020 this country should be able to create a middle-income society.’’
Chakwera was accompanied to the rally by Tembo and four of the other losing presidential aspirants during the party’s convention last week. The losing aspirants present included Former Chief Justice Lovemore Munlo, Former Farmers Union of Malawi President Felix Jumbe, member of parliament Watson Makala Ngozo and Former cabinet minister Jodder Kanjere.
He stressed that his leadership is set to bring both the MCP and Malawi as a nation back on track to realize its dreams and vision.
He said in the last years, Malawi has had brilliant plans such as the Vision 2020 and the millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but all these have failed to bear fruits because of lack of visionally leadership and proper direction.
Chakwera also said the other major problem with the country development path is that each administration comes with its own programmes and pans instead of having a national development plan that could be followed by each administration.
He said Malawi needs a common national vision and agenda if it is to move forward and develop.
‘’it is now fifty years since independence but nothing much has been done in terms fo development. At times we have signs that things are moving only to realise that we are back from where we started.
Why is that the case? This is the question that all of us have to answer,’’ said Chakwera.
He said one of his visions is to transform agriculture to make it into business and enhance agri- based exports, brings equity to the education sector so that both girls and boys as well as people in rural and urban areas have equal access to education, revamp the health a sector and that people should be able to freely do business that can bring them money.
On his party leadership, Chakwera said the new MCP offers hope to the people that have been looking for leadership that is selfless and that would be servant leadership.

1/4/2022,GOVT MOVES TO IMPROVE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE,"Minister of Information and DigitisationGospelKazakosays government isworking towards bringing down some taxes and formalising the information communication technology (ICT) sector.
The Minister made the remarks yesterday during a business breakfast organised by the ICTAssociation of Malawi (Ictam) to share notes on how to improve the country's digital landscape. Kazako said government wants to ensure that policies and implementation of programs speak to each other and that the private sector is engaged in the melisation of the digital economy. said: ""We intend to create te the Malawi Information ology Authority [Mita] to ensure  good coordination in government.
""As we stand, a lot of money is lost because there is no centrality in the way we operate. This will help us know what we have and do not have in the sector. All this is meant to spur uptake of digital services.""
Kazako also admitted that some taxes in the sector are a cause for concern and a limiting factor to digitisation, saying government is reviewing these and others to promote the use of digital tools.
Currently, available data indicate that only 13.8 percent of the Malawian population uses the internes. This is despite numerous developments in the sector, including extension of fibre- optic backbone and cross-border interconnections, the launch of 4G, the establishment of the Universal Service Fund whose overall goal was to have the country’s Internet connectivity improve and charges remarkably drop. Despite the initiatives, Malawi still lags behind on Internet connectivity characterized by high charges, low penetration rates and poor service provision, contributing to high  cost of doing business, limited innovation and poor information flow. On his part, Ictam president Bram Fudzulani said the association is keen to assist on the digitisation agenda by focusing on delivering reliable and affordable digital services in the country. “We have agreed to formalize ourselves and form a task force that plays a voluntary advisory role to the ministry on what we think are the best practices that need to be done and policies that need to be implemented so that we create a conducive environment for industry players and that the same tie protect consumers.”
Fudzulani also observed that formulation of Mita will bring in order and will help accelerate the adoption of ICTin the country. Previous studies indicated that taxation, market, and regulatory structures that do not encourage competition also slow down efforts for price reductions in mobile data packages and extension of broadband coverage.
Meanwhile, government is targeting to increase network access for internet usage to 80 percent of the population and broadband coverage to 95 percent of the population by 2026 from the current 13.8 percent. ",Orama Chipwanya,National Publications Limited,1

,USI TAKES OFF THE GLOVES ,"Faced with some pockets of resistance, Vice President Michael Usi says he is the Bonafide UTM Party President following the death of his predecessor Saulos Chilima in a military plane crash on June 10. 
His public declaration comes after the party’s hierarchy, led by secretary general Patricia kaliati, earlier announced the withdrawal of UTM party from the governing Tonse Alliance whose pact president Lazarus Chakwera and Chilima publicly signed on March 20, 2020. 
Speaking when he visited his home village Golden in Traditional Authority Chikumbu in Mulanje on Sunday afternoon. Usi said following Chilima’s death he automatically ascended to the party’s higher position. 
He said he will soon meet Kaliati to discuss the dates to call for the national executive committee (NEC) meeting. 
Said Usi ""Let me say this, some are saying l am the acting president of UTM,no. l am the president of UTM and that's the constitution says. 
“ I am not going  to fight anybody . So, l have to meet the secretary general to come up with the agenda as she is the one who needs to communicate [on the NEC meeting].”   
He said he had noted that there were some UTM Party members who are not happy with his position, but he will not fight back. 
“what l am saying to all UTM Party members who are castigating me and are not happy with me is that l just ask Giod to forgive them,” said Usi. 
Article 13(3) of the UTM Party states that “the vise – president shall assist the president and shall, in the case of delegation by, or absence, resignation, incapacity or death of, the president, exercise the powers and functions conferred on the president by this constitution.”  
The Article 13 (14) further provides that “in the event of resignation, incapacity or death of the president and the vise- president, the national executive committee shall, as soon as it practicable, but no later than ninety days from the event, appoint an acting president until such time as the National Delegates Conference shall convene and until such appointment is made.” 
But when contacted yesterday on Usi’s sentiment, Kaliati said it was difficult for her to comment because she was just hearing about the position from The Nation. 
She  said : “When SKC [ Saulos Klaus Chilima] was alive, i was not communicated to through the  media . Therefore, the official response will be a problem. If he (Usi) decides to say that to the media, it will be difficult for me to respond,” 
Commenting on the development, political analyst Ernest Thindwa observed that Usi’s declaration and Kaliati’s response indicate divisions in UTM. 
He noted that the absence of the party’s top hierarchy during Usi’s swearing – in ceremony as Vise – President in Lilongwe on June 21 corroborates his observation. 
Said Thindwa; “that is the indication that there is disunity in the UTM, but this is very unfortunate. This party needed tp demonstrate that it is united in the absence of Dr. Chilima. But this is an indication that the party is slowly dying after the former vise president’s death.” 
Chakwera appointed Usi as the country’s Vice-President, replacing Chilima who was also the UTM party president. 
Chilima alongside eight others died in a military plane crash on June 10. 
In the nullified 2019 presidential election. Chilima had picked Usi as his running mate, effectively becoming the party’s vice president as per constitution.  ",,National Publications Limited,1

The Veep first visited Ndirande on Monday , but speaking when returned to township on Friday, he said he followed up the matter and found a donor who has assumed to start the rehabilitation works instantly .

“we need  bridge that is fit for the purpose and we should move as quackly as possible so that before the rains starts , the bridge should be completed ,” he said. 
Usi noted that some people may not be happy with his tours, but said “i am ready to make enemies as long as i am making those enemies when i am saving the people of this country better”. 
In his remarks, Blantyre City deputy mayor Isaac Jomo Osman noted that the southern Region is being sidelined in terms of development projects. 
Said Osman “most of the roads here are in a dilapidated state. On Thursday, residents held demonstrations protesting the poor road network. But you should remember that politics begins in Ndirande . So, please help us with good roads” 
According to sources ,Nasolo bridge rehabilitation stalled about a year and half ago following disagreements between the donor and some Blantyre City Council (BCC) officials.

,Atupele trashes opinion polls ,"Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) presidential candidate Atupele Muluzi has described as bogus, opinion polls that have come out ahead of the May 20 Tripartite Elections. Atupele, who has been rated as a rank outsider on position four in two recent opinion polls, said at a news conference in Blantyre yesterday the surveys are aimed at distracting other candidates and their followers.  He claimed that some pollsters have ever approached him and offered their services to tip the opinion polls in his favour, but he refused. Said Atupele; “I have said no to this [sponsoring opinion polls]. People have made this business. But l want to assure Malawians that UDF is determined and focused to make the next government on May 20. These opinion polls are not credible.” Asked why he did not want to name and shame people that contacted him and offered to cook up an opinion poll in his favour, Atupele said Malawians know what is on the ground. He said; “The nation knows what is happening. This is propaganda in Zambia, there wre opinion polls that favoured Rupiah Banda [who was incumbent president] and placed Michael Sata far, but Sata won the elections.” The UDF torchbearer, who called for the news conference to outlined what his government would do should Malawians vote his party into power next Tuesday, said the scenario was the same in Kenya where opinion polls ruled out Uhuru Kenyatta, but he went on to win the presidency. He said UDF was not losing sleep over the opinion polls, challenging that his party has done a lot on the ground and was ready to govern and transform Malawi. An opinion poll released on Friday by the US – based Afrobarometer placed the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Peter Mutharika as a frontrunner with 27 percent of the vote followed by Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and incumbent President Joyce Banda of People’s Party (PP) at 21 and 19 percent respectively. The Afrobarometer opinion poll, conducted between March 23 and April 7, 2014, with a sample sized of 2400, placed Atupele on fourth position with 14 percent. Another earlier and most controversial opinion poll by Research Tech Consultants favoured Banda to win the forthcoming elections, followed by Chakwera, Mutharika and Atupele in that order.  During yesterday’s news conference, Atupele pledged that if voted into power, he would appoint a credible and professional Cabinet that will live within its means and comprise honest and accountable leaders that have Malawi’s best interest. Said Atupele; “[My administration will within 100 days] establish a permanent planning commission to oversee coherent policy planning and implementation.” Atupele said within 100 days, his government would set out a robust budget that clearly outlines hard choices within competing priorities and efforts to grow and stabilise Malawi through priority sector.

‘’It is a shame for Malawi to be classified as a least developed county 50 years after independence. Bunda is graduating hundreds of students every year, but we will face foo shortage in this country.
‘’There is nothing wrong with this county but our mindset. My advice to you is that when you graduate from here don’t aim at being employed at some body’s farm. Instead, think of opening your own farm. In this way, Malawi will easily develop,’’ said Chakwera

In a letter announcing his decision addressed to the party’s secretary general Kandi Padambo dated May 28 2022, Muluzi said he is “going into business for the development and progress of Malawi” Reads the letter in part; “In view of this decision and pursuant with the party constitution, I appoint Honourable Lilian Estella Patel, party vice – president Earsten Region to lead the party as acting president until the next national convention where my success will be elected. “I am truly grateful to the entire UDF family for the amazing confidence  and support given to me over the 18 years i have served in politics.” However, attemps to seek his f resh comment on the matter before we went to print at 9am proved futile as our calls to his mobile phone number went unanswered despite several attempts. But Padambo corfimed the news, saying he discussed the matter with Muluzi earlier in the day yesterday. “Yes, i can confirm that the letter is authentic. I met and discussed with him. He is of the view that he should help in developing the country by pursuing other avenues other than active politics,” he said. UDF treasurer general Ned Phoya, who is also the party’s leader in the House, confirmed that Muluzi has quit active politics. “What l know is that he wants to concentrate on his businesses. As a party, we do not have more information than the one on the statement.” Commenting on the issue, University of Malawi political analyst  Mustaphaahaussein described the news of Muluzi’s resignation as a sad development, He said’ “That is his choice . He is entitled to what he wants. However, this is a great loss to the nation. Honourable Muluzi has great potential. He is young and had a future in politics. At his age, he is accumulated vast experience and benefitted a lot from mentorship from his father [Bakili Muluzi] who once served the country as president . “Many people are reluctant to join active politics, but Honourable Muluzi sacrificed himself to serve the country in many portfolios. His contribution will be greatly missed. We hope in future he might come back into active politics,” In his remarks, CCAP Livingstonia Synod Church and Society executive director Moses Mkandawire wondered why Muluzi chose his successor. “UDF is repeating the mistake they made in 2003 when Bakili Muluzi just handpicked Bingu wa Mutharika as the party’s presidential candidate. “That is not good for democracy where the majority have to rule. I have not seen UDF constitution, but l wonder if it allow that.” He said Muluzi should have allowed the party’s convention to choose his successor. Muluzi paired Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president Peter Mutharika during the June 23 2020 court – sanctioned Fresh Presidential Elections but lost to incumbent Malawi leader Lazarus Chakwera and Vice – President Saulos Chilima. Meanwhile, following succession wrangles in DPP, some gurus in the former governing party suggested that Muluzi could pair Mutharika in the 2025 Presidential Election.

jobs.""
Chilima said with  favorable policies in place, technology offers a wide range of opportunities; hence, it is important that people start embracing technology in the context of job creation. it the Vice-President, who is also heading the Public Sector Reforms drive, said institutions should also have the capacity to analyze if they have the capability to train employees in understanding new technologies.

MEC chief elections officer Willie Kalonga disputed claims that MEC advise the to put on the donations, adding MEC never discussed with the PS or any official from Ministry of Health regarding the cheques.

,APM CENSURED OVER BINGU POISONING CLAIMS ,"Legal and political experts in the country have censured former president Peter Mutharika, fondly known as APM, over his remarks that his brother the late Bingu was poisoned in 2012. Speaking on Sunday during a press briefing he held at his retirement home in Mangochi, Mutharika alleged that Malawi's former president ""Bingu was poisoned, and something was put in his wine juice at 8am and at 10 he had died. ""It is the fact, and I know the people, but let us leave it here,"" he said. But his comments contradict the 2013 findings of the Commission of Inquiry into the circumstances that led to the death of Bingu wa Mutharika which show that he died on April 5 2012 on the way to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe. Reads part of the inquiry ""On the issue of cause of death, the commission has concluded from the evidence before it that the president died of cardiac arrest due to cardiac arrhythmia (irregular beating of the heart). However, in an interview yesterday, private practice lawyer John-Gitt Mwakhwawa, who also heads the Law Faculty at the Catholic University of Malawi, said the remarks have the potential to incite violence. He said: ""If that is the claim, it has legal implications. ""First, it was possibly a treasonous act because Bingu was a head of State. Therefore, you may be investigating issues surrounding treason."" Mwakhwawa called on law enforcement agencies such as the police to investigate Mutharika's claims. ""When did he know about that the poisoning)? What did he do about it and if he didn't do anything, himself being at one point head of State. ""If the claims are baseless the country will look at him as someone who is trying to incite contempt and violence."" University of Malawi's law professor Garton Kamchedzera said Mutharika was simply trying to use his brother's death for political advantage. He said: ""It is important to understand the former president not just as a person who lost a brother, but also as a politician. When speaking about this, I don't think he thought about the law and its implications. ""What he said has legal and political implications in that it will boomerang on him in terms of his credibility"". Kamchedzera wondered why Mutharika, who claimed to have known that his brother died at 10am, allowed the body to be flown to South Africa for further treatment. ""Mutharika had an opportunity to testify before the commission, and did he commit perjury?"" he asked a Blantyre-based political analyst. Ernest Thindwa wiwd Mutharika was looking for public sympathy. ""Bingu died as head of State and the nation has an interest in the security of a sitting president and security agencies should engage Mutharika on the claims to tell the nation what he knows,"" he said.

In an interview yesterday, Dandaula said he could not give more details due to on – going investigations but confirmed that police have in custody two security guards in connection with the attack. The raid Atupele’s residence comes against a background of concerns about rising cases of insecurity in the country. Two months ago, thieves broke into Mudi House in Blantyre, the official residence of Vice – president Saulos Chilima, and went away with assorted items, including bottles of wine. Yesterday, police sources told The Nation that the people who attacked Atupele’s residence had broken into the minister’s house searching for valuable items before storming the major bedroom where they demanded K500 000 cash.

,From Manganya to Vice  ,"Until his appointment as the country’s as the country’s new Vice – President, Michael Usi was saving as the Minister of Natural Resources and Climate Change in the Tonse Alliance administration. 
Usi, a senior member of UTM Party founded by the former Vice – President the late Saulos Klaus Chilima, who died in a plane crash on June 1o, joined active politics in 2018, after many years of working as an administrator. He was country director of Adventist Development and Relief agency (Adra). 
Born on december 6 1968 in Mulanje, he attended his primary and secondary schools in the same district before joining Malamulo Colllege of Health sciences in Thyolo. He graduated in 1991 with a diploma in Clinical medicine. He later obtained his bachelor’s degree international development from Andrew’s University in the United States of America. 
However, after working as a healthcare worker for some time, Usi Joined Adra where he championed number of relief and humanitarian projects. 
But in 2018, Usi surprised many when he declared that he was joining active politics. His intention was to contest for parliamentary seat for Mulanje Centra constituency. 
By then, he had been running a movement Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu, a political philosophy that sought to empower marginalized people. 
On February 6 2019, Malawians got another surprise when they saw Usi standing alongside Chilima as the letter’s running mate in May 2019 presidential Elections. 
Again, not for the first or second time, last night’s appointment was perhaps another surprise as most Malawians know him as Manganya a character he created in Tikuferanji soap opera. 
Usi, aka Manganya, has two master's degrees. The first is in international development and was obtained from the USA, the other is in strategic management from Derby University in the United Kingdom. 
In 2018, Usi successfully defended his PhD thesis on ‘The development of Malawi by investigating in the youth’ after studying at Bedfordshire University in the UK. ",,National Publications Limited,1

,Chakwera keen on reducing powers,"However, he said he believes It was time a review was made on the merits of having the Presidents also occupy an office such as chancellor of a public university.
‘’This is a relic from a bygone era that we need to part with, for I know of no free country in which the State President is put at the helm of an educational institutional that exists to produce free thinkers.
‘’that is one example of positional powers that need to be revisited. The second category of powers a president has is executive. This has to do with certain decisions that are received for a president to make. It is my view that there are too many decisions made by a president, so I mean to reduce that,’’ Chakwera said.
He said having a presidency that makes too many decisions has created problems for the country for a long time.
‘’This is a mistake we must stop making at a national level. There must be decisions that when made by parliament are final, and even where the president has the power to veto such decisions, he should no longer be allowed to sabotage the governance framework by sitting on the decision.’’
This was in direct reference to bills in parliament but would require the president to assent to them and before the June 23 fresh presidential election, former president Peter Muntharika was accused of frustrating the amendment of some electoral laws.
‘’The third category of powers a president has is that of appointments. From the judiciary, to the legislature, to the Executive, all the way to constitutionally mandated institutions designed to operate independently, the boards of statutory corporations, foreign embassies, and traditional leaders, we have the anomaly of having all of them look to the president as the appointing authority,’’ Chakwera said.
The president said it is not possible for a President to be the appointing authority of many offices without at some point coming face to face with a conflict of interest.
Within culture change towards the presidency, Chakwera asked for a rethink on overlap between party and state functions to prevent abuse.
Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC) chairperson Gift Trapence in an interview supported Chakwera’s stance to trim the presidential powers, saying too nuch powers concentrated in the presidency is the reason presidents in the past became dictatorial; hence, made grave mistakes.",,National Publications Limited,1

,Atupele dares UDF to embrace democracy ,"Former United Democratic Front (UDF) president Atupele Muluzi has kept a tight lid on his political future and says his presence at the party’s rally in Mangochi on May 7 will deminstrate unity and maturity. 
His sentiments come against a background of some UDF members expressing fear that Atupele wants to reclaim his position and one of his strategies is through political rallies he has lined up ahead of the party’s convention. 
Atupele, son to former president Bakili Muluzi, resigned as the party’s president in May 2022, saying he was going into business for the development and progress of Malawi. The party appointed veteran politician Lilian Patel to lead the party. 
However, ahead of the Mangochi rally some party officials have expressed fear that Atupele is strategising to reclaim his position as president. 
 But UDF secretary general Kandi Padambo said in an interview yesterday that the party’s national working committee has allowed Atupele to hold the initial rally at St. Augustine Ground in Mangochi on May 7, 2023. 
He said the committee would make a decision at a later date on the proposed rallies by Atupele this year in Ndirande Township, Blantyre on May 21, Lilongwe on June 3 and Mzuzu on June 17. 
In an interview yesterday, Atupele said UDF is a united party that believes in the fundamental principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. 
He said: “It has an indelible place in the country’s political history. This rally in Mangochi will demonstrate to all Malawians that the UDF is united, strong party and ready to play its rightful role in the governance of the country. 
“People need not to fear, it is the people that elect their leaders and they should be free to do so, this is the purpose of democracy right?” 
Atupele said the party would soon be holding its convention to elect new office – bearers and all bona fide members are free to contest for any position, including that of the president ahead of the 2025 Tripartite Elections.

,Ericsson donates computers to ZA schools,"Ericsson Limited, through the Millennium Village Project (MVP), on Wednesday gave 50 laptop computers to St Anthony and Mayera Community Day Secondary School (CDSS) during a function held at St Anthony in Zomba.
The computers are part of the connect to learn (CTL) programme which MVP is implementing in schools from Mwandama Cluster under Traditional Authority Mlumbe in the district.
Speaking when presenting the computers, Ericsson (Kenya) Limited’s Lois Mbagua said her company is participating in enhancing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on education.
“The purpose of MDG 3 is gender parity and universal education, we are donating computers to MVP who selects the beneficiary schools in their catchment area. I can say out of the 10 schools in Sub-Sahara Africa, we are giving at least 25 computers per school,’ she said.
MVP team leader and science coordinator Dr Andrew Daudi said 50 girls won the CTL scholarship and qualified to receive the computers.
Said Daudi; ‘’St Anthony will get 35 laptop computers whereas Mayera will receive 15. These computers will enhance communication in many other things, so, I urge parents and teachers to look after this property and nurture the gift.’’
Speaking on behalf of the students, Overton Phiri thanked MVP for the donation.

,Atupele's motorcade raises eyebrows   ,"Political and legal minds have described as “a waste of public resources “ the allocation of a motorcade with a police escort vehicle and enhanced security to President Peter Muthalika’s running mate Atupele Muluzi. During his whistle – stop rallies in Eastern Region districts of Zomba, Machinga, Balaka and Mangochi on saturday Atupele – who is United Democratic Front (UDF) president and ministers in Muthalika’s Cabinet – was seen using a motorcade, including a police lead vehicle (sweeper) with a siren and amber lights. This development came barely two days after mutharika, who is Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) torchbearer in the July 2 presidential election return, named Atupele as his running mate.  The two parties are in an electoral alliance. In a written response yesterday, Garton Kamchezera, a professor of law at Chancellor College – a constituent college of the University of Malawi, said there is no legal basis to accord a Cabinet minister or presidential running mate such a privilege. He said; “These are the soft of privileges and benefits accorded to the President and Vice – President under the President under the Presidents [Salaries and Benefits] Act. If it has to be done, l cannot find any law that permits the use of resources. This sort of abuse of public resources and opportunity is an indication of a creeping self–centered dictatorship. “This is because the President is requiring or allowing privilege and advantage for his running mate in disregard of the Constitution and the law in general.” In a separate interview, politicians –cum – commentator Humphrey Mvula said the development can be attributed to a political attempt to raise the profile of Atupele, son to the country’s former president Bakili Muluzi. He said; “However, on a broader scheme of things, this is a serious abuse of power and an abuse of public resources by the President. His competitors will use it against him and some CSOs may consider taking the matter to court.” Speaking on condition of anonymity a retired senior police officer said while a motorcade can be assigned to anyone, priority is given to the President, Vice – President and other important visiting dignitaries, including heads of State.  “The lead vehicle acts as a warning to people ahead that anything may happen,” said the retired senior police officer. Minister of Information Civic Education and Communications Technology Mark Botomani said the arrangement does not mean anything significant. He referred the matter to National Police spokesperson James Kadadzera who could, however, not be reached on his phone. When then Ntcheu North East Legislator Everton Chimulirenji, now serving as Minister of Disaster Management Affairs and Public Events, was unveiled as Mutharika’s running mate in the disputed May 21, 2019, Tripartite Elections, he was also accorded beefed up security and a motorcade.

,Chakwera keen on clean cities,"’The city rates themselves are not diligently collected or paid, even though the money is desperately needed; and even the trash of our cities is not properly disposed of, which is both a health hazard and an eye sore.
‘’We can not blame city authorities or street vendors alone for this mess. We all use and need our cities in one way or another, we are not all pulling together in the same direction to create for our country the kind of cities that can be said to be modern, or organised, or beautiful,’’ Chakwera said.
On Friday, Lilongwe city Council vowed to remove all illegal vendors plying their trade in the streets of the capital, saying the decision is final.
Lilongwe City Council mayor Juliana Kaduya said in an interview following a protect by some vendors who marched to Civic Offers in City centre on Friday to force the city fathers to rescind plans to conduct the clean up exercise.
On Thursday, Kaduya, who was escorted by police officers and other stakeholders, toured part of Old Town where illegal vending has been worsening over the years and the mayor’s visit gave a signal to the vendors that the new administration was planning to remove them from the streets; hence, the protest.
According to Kaduya, the vendors who stormed Lilongwe City Council premises acknowledged that they were trading in undesignated places but pleaded for more time before being removed.
The mayor, however, observed that the council would not rescind its plans because it wants to deal with lawlessness that has now characterised the capital city.
Said Kaduya: ‘’Imagine we now have people openly selling ‘zigege’ and fresh vegetables right on the streets? Where in the world do such things happen? I know others would like to politicise this clean up but this new government will not relent and we will ensure that our town is admirable.’’
She said the exercise of removing the vendors ought to have been executed a few days ago but the council has gone back to the drawing board to restrategise with its stakeholders such as police on how best to carry out the exercise.
In an interview, one vendor Cathy Bokosi from Area 36, who sells bananas, said the only ideal place to do her business is in the central business district, adding that once vendors are removed, she will struggle to feed her family.
She said: ‘’At least I make K5 000 on a good day and it is enough to keep us going at home, who can buy my bananas in our township? We rely on these well-to-do people who come into town.’’
But a governance expert Makhumbo Munthali in an interview last night attributed the problem to politicians, who in their attempt to win votes, have let vendors trade in unauthorised spaces in the cities.
‘’You actually see authorities slowing down in moving out street vendors that ply their trade in unauthorised spaces, especially when we’re going towards elections.
‘’I hope the Tonse Alliance administration is serious about this and will push vendors to the designated areas they belong to, they need not be apologetic about it,’’ Munthali said.
The streets in the cities are filthy and apart from selling vegetables along some pavements of some city buildings, some streets vendors are, at worst, roasting meats, sausage and green maize right in the middle of the cities.

17/09/2022,"Embrace digital, minister urges local accountants","Minister of Finance and Economic Affair Sosten Gwengwe has urged local accountants to move with modern times and embrace digital in their operations, saying a digital economy is a precursor to socio-economic development.
He said this on Thursday evening in Mangochi during the opening of the three-day 2022 Institute of Chartered Accountants in Malawi (Icam) Annual Lakeshore Conference in Mangochi.
Gwengwe said as the country is heading towards a robust digital economy, accounting professionals should be the first to embrace the digital philosophy.
""Embrace digital payments.Embrace online transactions.Allow investments in information and communications technology infrastructure,"" said the minister. ""Let the training of accountants flourish through virtual models. It is high time the curriculum embraces digital financing models."" Speaking at the conference themed 'Digitising the Malawi Economy: Stepping Into the New Future, Gwengwe said a robust digital economy starts with its being embraced by the citizenry.
But he rued what he called ""clandestine dealing mindset"" that is not open to transparent models  of doing things.
""As a result, our embracing of digital solutions is looked upon with scepticism as we fear that we might be exposed. This ought to change. This digital revolution is meant to steer our country into a new direction of progress,"" said Gwengwe.
He said the government system is slowly embracing a digital economy which is key to processing of financial transactions, thereby reducing risks as it is easy to follow the movement of money. “Digital transactions have trails that can easily be followed at the click of a button,”said Gwengwe. In her remarks, outgoing Icam president Phales Kachingwe said there is no denying that the accounting profession cannot be left behind. She said  “Digital revolution is taking over. As accountants, we have an opportunity to change with the times or we will remain behind.””We have to embrace technology, master technology and make it part and parcel of the profession.” Kachingwe said digitization brings efficiency, adding that in the education sector, for instance, digital economy provides hope to those residing in hard-to-reach areas. Icam acting chief executive officer Charles Chimpeni said the group's membership has grown to nearly 3 000, and their plan is to hit 3 500 by the end of this year and 4 000 by 2023.

Atupele made the pledge on Friday during a public lecture held at Chancellor College, a Unima constituent college, centred around the youths and political leadership. He said the current situation where the sitting president is chancellor of the university has created problems for the institution whenever lecturers, students and government have differed. In 2011, Unima lecturers were locked in a protracted eight months battle with government over academic freedom after former inspector general of police Peter Mukhito summoned Dr Blessings Chinsinga of Chancellor College to explain remarks he made in a policy class. Former president the late Bingu wa Mutharika defended Mukhito to the end, saying the police chief would not apologise to the lecturers for his actions. The battle grounded Chancellor College, the University’s main campus, which remained closed throughout the duration of the dispute after lecturers boycotted classes. “I dont think it will be wisw for me to cling to the position when history has shown that academic freedom is affected.

,TEMBO TAKES GRACCEFULL BOW,"Former Malawi Congress Party (MCP) president John Tembo yesterday hailed the party’s convention which barred him from standing for third term, said democracy triumphed.
Tembo, one of the longest serving politicians in MCP as well as in the country’s said in an interview the convention decided on the sticky issue of too many presidential aspirants.
Delegates to the MCP convention held at Natural resources College (NRC) in Lilongwe elected former Malawi Assemblies of God president the Reverend Dr Lazarous Chakwera to be the party’s torchbearer in the 2014 presidential elections.
He said, “I am delighted with the process. Democracy has triumphed.’’
Tembo said he offered to retire from the national executive committee (NEC) and from standing as a presidential candidate.
‘’the convention agreed [to request].’’ Said Tembo, who told delegates to decide whether he could content for a third term.
He added; ‘’I could not stand if the constitution was not amended. Delegates said they could not amend the constitution, so the convention agreed with my request to retire.’’
But Tembo dodged questions on what lies ahead in his political career.
Tembo first contested for a parliamentary seat in the first multiparty general elections in 1961.
He rose through the ranks while holding some of the key positions in government, including that of minister of Finance and minister of state as well as governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM).
Tembo was one of the key figures in MCP throughout the party’s 31-year rule under the late Hastings Kamuzu Banda which ended in May 1994.
Political scientists have said MCP convention delegates rejection of Tembo from standing is a manifestation that constitutionalism was taking root in the party.

,Mandalas Legacy can move Malawi forward – Chakwera,"Malawi Congress Party (MCP) president Reverend Lazarus Chakwera yesterday said departed South Africa icon Nelson Mandales legacy can help move Malawi forward if its leaders and servants can embrace his selflessness, peacemaking forgiveness, discipline and honest among others.
Chakwera said this at press briefing at Kamuzu International Airport (KIA) on his arrival from South Africa where he had gone to pay his last respects to Mandale.
Before landing, there was a scaring moment as the plane Chakwera boarded aborted landing after already touching the KIA runway and stayed air for about 20 minutes.
Said Chakwera; ‘’ Nelson Mandale maybe buried, but his ideals resonate with human struggle. The discipline with which he led his life and South Africa people to give them freedom is one which we can learn from. We can make Malawi a country for all people and where everybody is valued regardless of region where one is coming from.
‘’He has taught us that you we can conquer hatred with love and have a society with inclusiveness. As a nation that is seeking to rebuild its foundations, it is possible that we can disciple ourselves and take the obstacles we are facing at steppingstones to the future we all want,’’ said Chakwera.
He said he views Mandales body on Friday at the Union Building in Pretoria where it lay in state for three days before burial on Sunday.
He said it is against the spirit of reconciliation, forgiveness and love to deny business opportunities who have fallen out of favor with the incumbent leadership.
‘’Nobody should be victimized because of change of leadership in government. In terms of development, it is critical that business should shrive regardless of who is in government. What we need Is to embrace integrity, honesty and faithfulness as characteristics of selfless leadership,’’ he said.",Phillip Pemba,National Publications Limited,1
,Can Usi fulfill his political philosophy? ,"Bofore Usi joined active politics in 2018, he had radical ideas . 
His ideas, which he shared through his movement called Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu, focused mainly on how to empower marginalised masses to live fulfilled lives. 
To him, a fulfilled life include having the means to generate  income , being politically conscious to understand or to descern politic rhetoric and become agents of change in society. 
Thus, he did not tire to speak against what he percieved as injustice when people, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds, were failing to get basic necessities such as food, shelter and clothing. In his many radio and television interviews, Usi condemned some government policies which, he said, were not helping the poor become economically independent. 
Usi continued to speak on the behalf of the poor, fighting for their rights to economic prosperity through his Tikuferanji soap opera, aired on malawi Broadcasting corporation (MBC) Due to its criticism of government’s policies and decisions, MBC stopped airing the soap. 
But that did not stop him from preaching his ideas of justice and fairness for all. He started addressing people at rallies, expounding his Odya Zake Alibe , Mlandu philosophy. 
Usi established branches Nationwide. He criss – crossed the country, telling people not to lay their hopes in the politicians’ hands because they could not save them from their poverty. 
During his trips to Nsanje Boma, Madziabango in Blantyre and Mulanje, Usi talked about the importance of people finding means to generate income and stop patronising politicians for handouts. 
In July, he told people in Nsanje that only empowered people can make sound decisions. He said only people who depends on themselves sleep peacefully, without having to worry about being arrested or bullied by their benefactors. 
In his speech, Usi gave an analogy  of a married couple that decides to hug in a bush. 
He said; “ munthu woti watenga mkazi wamwini kupita naye ku loji amayenda mwamantha kuti akugwira. Koma munthu oti watenga mkazi wako, olo utamuhaga pa tchire akakuona, angonena kuti musiyeni akudza zake ( if you take somebody’s wife to a lodge, you will be afraid of being caught, but when you are with your wife,you can even hug her in the bush and people will not cast stone at you). 
Throuhg this analogy, Usi drove a very important lesson home that there is joy and dignity in one’s labour. 
His philosophy challenged the notion that government or politicians are the solutions to people's problems. To the contrary, politicians, according to Usi, were the source of people's problems. 
When john F. Kennedy was sworn in as American president, he told people not to think about what the government can do for them, but what they can do for the government. 
Oftentimes, people have looked to government or politicians to solve their problems, only to get disappointed in the end, urgued Usi.  
“He who feeds you controls you, handouts from politicians create Beggars out of people. Handouts reduce you to mere objects and gives politicians opportunity to exploit you,” he said 
His message, comes at a time poverty levels were escalating, resonated with the masses.Some of this people were surviving on relief food almost every year. Hunger caused by climate change shocks and poverty exercarbated by limited employment and business opportunities almost made many people lose hope and start thinking that handouts were the only way to earn a living.  
The situation was not what the nationalist leaders envisaged during the struggle for independence for the nationalist leaders were fighting for the country to achieve freedom and economic emancipation. 
Yet, according to Tiyambe Zeleza’s Smouldering Charcoal, Politicians that took over power from the British colonial administration betrayed those dreams. 
Zeleza argued that the leaders enriched themselves at the expense of the people they wre supposed to empower socio – economically. 
This is what Usi condemned and swore to change through his movement. 
Ironically, Usi joined active politics in 2018 to rub shoulders with the very politicians he criticised of betraying the masses. 
In July 2018, he attended the launch of a political party founded by former vise – president Saulos Chilima at Nyamba Freedom Park in Blantyre. 
 In his short speech, Usi reminded Chilima and other politicians who joined Chilima’s UTM party not to betray the throng that has gathered at the park. 
That afternoon, Usi said; “ Panotu babwera anthu ambiri. Koma choti mudxiwe ndi chakuti inu siwoyamba kudxadzitsa anthu pa Njamba pano. Mbuyomu enatu andale anatera koma mapeto ake adakhumudwitsa anthu (you are not the first politicians to attract a huge gathering at Njamba. Some poiticians have done it before but they ended up betraying the...... once ... into power). 
Usi eventually joined UTM party to work with Chilima, and together form a ....... to take over power from the Democratic Progressive Party. Their campaign ...................  
He said; “ Ine ndili mwana, kwathu ndimadya mkute mawamawa. Koma lero ndi angati m’midzimu womwe amadya mkute?  (when l was young, i used to eat nsima left the previous night, but there days, children rarely eat such leftovers because thay dont have enough to eat). 
However, chilima and Usi did not win the presidency in 2019. When the court ordered for a fresh presidential election. Chilima became Chakwera’s running mate in the 2020 fresh presidential elections. 
The situation deprived Usi of a chance to fulfill his political beliefs through a UTM and government. 
However, last week, Chakwera appointed him Vice- President following the death of Chilima in a plane crash. ",,National Publications Limited,1
,Muluzi's ambitious pledge for Karonga ,"United Democratic Front (UDF) presidential hopeful Atupele Muluzi and running mate Frank Mwenifumbo have promised to revamp Kalonga’s business culture if elected next Tuesday. They said this during a Rally at Balaka Community Day Secondary School in the shoreline border district on Saturday. Muluzi stated that the district bordening Tanzania is best – placed to be the hub of business that can spur Malawi’s economic growth and regional integration in the line with the 16 – nation Southern African Development Community (Sadc) treaty. He pledged to end regionalism and form an inclusive administration that will “share the national cake equally and equitably”. Muluzi said he demonstrated his new agenda for change by picking Karonga Central ex – legislator Mwenifumbo, who he described as “the most hardworking and experienced politician”. He stated; “If you elect us on May 21, we will continue where UDF stopped in 2004. For starters, it is UDF that brought cellphones, free primary school education, TV station and more radio stations. The UDF – led government will bring more innovations that will also bring job opportunities to the youth. “If the Northern Region registered meaningful developments, it was during the UDF era. Talk of Mzuzu Courthouse, Mzuzu Centra Hospital.” Mwenefumbo said only Muluzi can restore economic activities in Karonga. He promised that the UDF administration will exempt salaries workers earning less thanK150 000 a month from tax, up front K35 000. He also promised to raise the minimum wage from K25 000 to K70 000.

,Experts warn Chakwera on new laws,"Law experts have warned that any attempts by the new Tonse Alliance administration to formulate legislations or amend existing laws targeting people that committed crimes in the past regime would not pass the constitutionality base.
The legal experts have said if the ideas is to criminalise some thing that was not criminal or to make criminal laws to apply on crime committed in the past; it would be illegal and unacceptable.
President Chakwera, in his national address on July 25 2020, said his administration had resolved to forgo amnesty that could be offered to looters of public funds but would instead in consultation with minister of justice and constitutional affairs, initiate a process to come up with new legislations to help his government deal with politicians or public servants that plundered the public purse during the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration.
The Minister of Justice said no meeting has taken place yet on the issue of new legislation the president spoke about.
Mvalo said such issues that require the attention of the Cabinet remain confidential until at a time such issues are laid before the parliament.
Attorney General (AG) Chikosa silungwe, on the other hand, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was aware of the president’s intentions to have the new legislation but said a planned meeting between the president and other relevant officials was yet to take place.
Silungwe said he was not in a position to discuss more before that meeting takes place.
‘’Give us some time, I will be able to furnish you with more information after that meeting,’’ the AG said.
However, Chakwera’s spokesperson Sean Kampondeni said in a response to a questionnaire gaps in the current legislation are to do with stiffer punishments for looters and protections for whistle blowers.
‘’Other gaps have to do with the need for a legislative framework for the creation for special courts to deal with corruption cases and dispose of them expeditiously.
‘’Another gap has to do with legislation related to lifestyle audits and the seizure of inexplicable wealth owned by both public servants and their proxies behind whom they may attempt to hide their ill-gotten wealth,’’ Kampondeni said.
He further said there are legislative gaps related to holding financial institutions accountable for being complicit in the movement of illicit funds, including banks that fail to do their part in ensuring that their accountants are not conduits for harboring stolen taxes.
Chakwera’s spokesperson admitted laws do not apply retrospectively, but said the biggest problem in Malawi was that even existing laws have not been enforced at all, resulting in a culture of stealing and looting public funds with impunity.
‘’His Excellency Dr. Lazarus Chakwera has made it abundantly clear that such impunity will be countenanced no longer,’’ he said. Chakwera in his address to the nation on July 25 warned people that stole public funds that they should avoid seeking public sympathy but return what they stole as the law is going to take its course on them.
In the address, the president referred to the recent auditor’s genera’s report in demonstrating that the culture of corruption has permeated every structure in government.chakwera said it would be up to the courts to exercise leniency on people who would not waste their time by ‘’confessing’’ their signs and return what they stole.
‘’Other people think we choose who to arrest; that’s not our style. We’ll allow the responsible authorities to do their job. State agents would operate depending on what evidence thay have, but we’ll not push them to do something,’’ Chakwera said.
The president said the plunder under the DPP administration was pervasive as about K1.3 million was lost, but asked Malawians to be calm as the Tonse Alliance administration drains the swamp.Chakwera hinted he considered taking this route after their discovery that the fraud, corruption and theft committed during the DPP administration was unimaginable and worse that the infamous cash gate, with a system rotten to the core.
But law expert Justin Dzonzi warned in an interview yesterday that coming up with new legislations or amending criminal laws to target a particular group of people that supposedly committed what were not offences in the past would be a process in futility as such would easily be challenged.
‘’But we do have sufficient laws to achieve desires of the president even without coming up with new legislations. To amend the laws, in theory it is possible, but chances are high that it cannot pass constitutionality base.
‘’Retrospectively will be one issue to make it illegal. That process, if indeed that’s the intention, is not necessary. We’ve penal code, Corrupt Practices Act and Financial Crimes Act, enough to adequately deal with all the issues at hand,’’ Dzonzi said.
Garton Kamchedzera, a professor of law at University of Malawi’s Chancellor College, said in an interview yesterday that it depends on what Chakwera’s administration wants to do with changes they want to make.
‘’If it’s to do with fine-tuning procedures to make a particular law efficient and effective, that’s fine. But if it’s creating offences where there was none, it will be a challenge,’’ Kamchedzera said.
He said any new law start applying from the date it has been enacted.
Kamchedzera said there can only be exceptions in other laws than criminal where parliament can expressly state that a particular law would apply retrospectively and proceed to have it backdated.
He said in criminal law, courts presume that an act of parliament does not apply retrospectively unless parliament expressly states so.
‘’When it comes to criminal law, the issues of rights come in. If something was not an offence, it means the person affected was not guided rightly and you cannot punish that person,’’ he said.
Kamchedzera said so, too, is the case of amending the law to bring stiffer punishment would only start applying from the time an amendment is made, not retrospectively.
But Titus Mvalo, who is minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs in the Tonse Alliance administration ushered into power through the court-sanctioned June 23 2020 fresh presidential election, said in an interview yesterday that what the president hinted on are issues that have processed that begin at Cabinet level.",FRANK NAMANGALE ,National Publications Limited,1

, Usi replaces Chilima as country’s Vice – President  ,"Minister of Natural Resources and Climate Change Michael Usi will this afternoon be sworn in as the country’s Vice – President replacing Saulos Chilima who died in a plane crash on June 10 alongside eight others. 
This follows President Lazarus Chakwera’s exercise of his office’s powers under Section 84 (2) of the constitution to “appoint a person to fill the vacancy in the Office of First Vice – President within seven days from the date the vacancy arose”.  
Secretary to the President and Cabinet Colleen Zamba said in a statement last evening that Usi’s appointment is with immediate effect. 
Reads the statement “His Excellency Dr Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera, President of the Republic of Malawi, in exercise of his powers under Section 84 of Constitution of the Republic of Malawi, has appointed Dr Michael Bizwick Usi, as Vice – President of the Republic of Malawi. 
“The Vice – President Designate, the Right Honourable Dr Michael Bizwick Usi, shall take his oath of office on Friday, 21 June 2024, at the Parliament Building [in Lilongwe] at 15:00 hours.” 
Ironically, in the 2019 Tripartite Elections he paired with Chilima as his running mate on the maiden UTM Party ticket in the disputed presidential election that was nullified in February 2020 after Chilima and Malawi Congress Party (MCP) candidate Chakwera petitioned the courts. In the court sanctioned presidential vote in June 2020, Chakwera teamed up with Chilima and triumphed. 
Usi last evening declined to comment on his appointment and suggested that he be interviewed at a later date. 
On the other hand, UTM Party spokesperson Felix Njawala said he would react later to the appointment . However, by press time at 10,30pm he was yet to revert. 
However, the political pundits have hailed Chakwera for the choice of new Vice – President, saying it shows his respect to the partnership between MCP and UTM in the Tonse Alliance and a perfect honour to Chilima’s soul. 
But the pundits differ on Usi’s ability to help Chakwera garner more votes in the September 16, 2025, General elections. 
In an interview, University of Malawi associate professor of political science Boniface Dulani said the appointment will cement relations between MCP and UTM. 
He said it is inevitable that there will be some pockets of resistance in UTM Party, especially as some members do not perceive Usi as the party’s loyal member’ 
Said Dulani; “It’s a safe appointment to the extent that Dr, Chilima and this shows the president has appointed the most senior person in UTM Party. It also shows some commitment to the alliance and honours Chilima. 
“Of course, there will be some people within UTM who will ne unhappy because there have been romours about the loyalty of Dr, Michael Usi to UTM. But if the president had overlooked this appointment and picked someone else from UTM, it could also have put him in a very awkward position,” 
He said there are also people within the  MCP who could have wanted one of their own to be appointed but that could not have held the alliance together. 
Political Science Association spokesperson Mavuto Bamusi urged Usi to continue, among others, publishing for public sector reforms that the late Chilima championed. 
He said; “Malawi has been lacking in corporate governance and public sector accountability, which all need public sector reforms. So, Usi has to push for this. He should also advance the anti–corruption agenda which Chilima used to champion. 
“Further, the VP should advance the unity card because Malawi is in dire need for unity because this is key to development. Finally, he should not be bent pleasing the MCP or shy party supporters but put interest of Malawians at heart. 
Unlike Dulani, Bamusi noted that the choice of Usi could be repositioning political dynamics towards running mates in the September 2025 elections where parties are looking at gaining votes from other region.

,Malawians deserve better leadership- Atupele  ,"Former United Democratic Front (UDF) leader Atupele Muluzi says he is championing a reset button for a new Malawi to save lives of Malawians, suffering due to current poor governance and bad leadership. 
He said this yesterday at St Augustine III Primary School ground in Mangochi District during the party’s mega rally held to commemorate its 30th anniversary. 
Atupele told thousands of suppoters that gathered at the venue that Malawians are getting poorer and are wallowing in poverty under the Tonse Aliiance administration led by President Lazarus Chakwera. 
He said Tonse leadership has failed to take care of them and they deserve better leadership come 2025. 
Atupele said; “Malawi chose democracy 30 ago to choose leaders of their choice to run the country while improving people’s welfare. We call this power to the people. This means you have power. 
“But it is unfortunate that there is nothing that is progressing in the country. But, if you want chane, it is possible if you can decide it [in 2025].” 
He further said it is unfortunate that the once blessed Malawi is now enveloped with corruption which is affecting the development of the country. 
“Malawi is engulfed with corruption. However, l have a hope that it is only UDF that an end all this.” he said attracting applause from the party supporters. 
The former UDF leader, who is also son to former president and party,s founder Bakili Muluzi, said he has hope that UDF, which ruled the country from the dawn of multiparty democracy in 1994 to 2005, could bounce back to power in 2025. 
“All we need is to join hands and make the party strong again. 
We need to reclaim our glory and serve Malawians from the current problems,” said Atupele. 
Taking her turn, the party’s interim president Lilian Patel said UDF is rebulding and remains a strong party. She said the party is poised to rise again and reclaim government. 
She said; “We need to join hands. Lets tighten our seet belts until we go to convention to elect leaders who can steer the country. In 1994 we were a force to reckon with that crounced Malawi Congress Party (MCP). So, in the same vein, let’s join hands to take back the government. “

,Atupele resignation shakes UDF ,"United Democratic Front (UDF) has called for an emergency national executive committee meeting (NEC) meeting this week to discuss the way forward following the resignation of its leader  Atupele Muluzi. UDF secretary general  Kandi Padambo said in an interview yesterday that Atupele’s resignation come as a shock to party members from top to the grassroots. His sentiments come a day some after some UDF members in the Northern Region wrote his office, expressing their disappointment over Atupele’s move. In the latter, the members from the North asked Atupele, son to the country’s former president and UDF founding leader Bakili Muluzi, to reverse his decision, saying he is a “ capable leader” who can lead the party to form the next government. Padambo said his office is expecting more letters from other regions as Atupele’s resignation come as a surprise as he did not consult MEC.  He said; “Many members from all the regions have expressed disappointment and would like the president to reverse that decision. “So, we have to meet as a party and formulate a collective response to the president’s decision.” On whether Atupele’s resignation will affect the party’s alliance with the Democratic progressive party, Padambo said their alliance was only for the June 23 2020 court – sanctioned Fresh Presidential Elections and that each party is now working on its own. In a letter dated May 29 2022 addressed to Padambo, the Northern Region members said they understand that UDF is a party, but at the same time Atupele is the brand that the party has groomed over the years. Reads the letter in part; “In view of the foregoing, members, through you our Secretary General, would like to sincerely appeal and request the honourable president to consider rescinding his decision.” But in separate interviews yesterday, UDF leadership in the Southern, Central and Eastern regions said they will respect Atupele’s decision. UDF regional governor for the East Alhaj Abdul Nkata said no one can challenge Atupele’s decision because nobody forced him to join politics. He said; “He [Atupele] hasn’t argued with anyone, but he has just decided to quit active politics and concentrate on other personal issues. So, as the Easten Region, we welcome his decision because he joined politics himself and has also resigned himself.” While welcoming Atupele’s resignation. UDF acting regional governor for the South Charles Chikuwo said the party was an institution, as such a leader’s departure would not mean the end of it. On his part, UDF vice – president (centra) Michael Antoine also accepted Atupele’s decision. He said Atupele had always wanted to serve Malawians, but being a president in the opposition was frustrating his attempts to contribute to the betterment of Malawians. But writing on his Facebook page yesterday, Atupele said he had left politics to transition into a Pan – African business executive. He said with global business partners, he intended to immediately lead in a mini – industrial and economic revolution for the progress and development of Malawi. Commenting on the matter, political analyst Ernest Thindwa said he was not suprised that some UDF supporters were disappointed by Atupele’s decision. He said that for so long, the party has ridden on the Muluzi brand and the resignation marks the end of the UDF/Muluzi marriage. Said Thindwa; “Perhaps this is an opportunity to rebuild the party. The party should not be dependent on an individual and personalised. It’s high time the party moved without the Muluzi brand.” On his part, political commentator Humphrey Mvula expressed suprise at the way Atupele handled his resignation, saying he was supposed to make his announcement at the NEC meeting. However, he said the resignation will give an opportunity to transform UDF from being a regional party to a national party. Said Mvula; “It is a defining moment for the party to retrace its roots. It’s a positive development as the party will not be associated with a family (muluzi). At least for the first time the next leader will not be a Muluzi.” Atupele took over the party’sleadership in 2012 at theexpertisee of Friday Jumbe, George Nga Mtafu (now deceased) and Moses Dossi during the party’s convention succeeding his father former president Bakili Muluzi who was the party’s chairperson. According to UDF spokesperson Yusuf Mwawa, the former president now the party patron as there is no chairmanship role in the UDF constitution. Atupele become a second high ranking UDF official to quit after first vice – president Lance Mbwewe . UDF performance in elections has been dwindling since 1999 general elections when it amassed 91 parliamentary seats after it got 85 in the 1994 elections. In 2004, the party had 49 legislators 16 in 2009 and 14 in 2014. As of now, UDF has 10 parliamentarians. ",,National Publications Limited,1

, Usi dares councils to be creative on funding  ,"Vice- President Michael Usi has urged local councils in the country to put extra effort to mobilise resources for their respective projects to supplement allocations from central government. 
Speaking at Chikwawa District Hospital on Wesdnesday, he noted that some government ministries, departments and agencies (MDA’s) solely rely on government funding. 
Usi's sentiment follows concern by some district councils that low levels of government funding are one of the major challenges affecting service delivery. 
He said; “Let us not get used to problems. It is us who change . Write a proposal and identify a donor who can help us because the government cannot do everything on its own. So many people are just sitting blaming  government. Let's blame our thinking.” 
In May this year. Ministry of Local Government, National Unity and Culture indicated that the K3.2 billion councils were due to receive  in the last financial year remains estimates, not arrears as it was due to resource constraints. 
Secretary for Local Government Richard Hara said this in the awake of councils’ concerns that 20 councils were still owed about K3.2 billion for the 2023/24 fiscal year despite several queries to the Treasury. 
He said authorities were aware of the problem and will be addressing the issue as time goes, insisting that councils should know that the government budget is only an estimate. 
During his visit to Bangwe, Chilomoni, Nthukwa and Chirimba markets in Blantyre yesterday, Usi said his office is working with the Ministry of Local Government, unity and Culture to find a lasting solution for resource constraints most councils are facing.  
He also said government has removed collateral as a required for small- scale businesspeople to access National Economic Empowerment Funds (Neef) loans to enable them to get the loan. 
Usi further emphasis that Neef loans will benefit every small- scale businesspeople regardless of their political affiliation. 
He said; “From July [This month] to August you will get Neef loans without collateral. 
These loans applicants shouldn’t be politicians because Malawi Congress Party, DPP [Democratic progress part], UTM and UDF [United Democratic Front] supporters are Malawians even those without political parties should also benefit, but there is need for discipline,”

,"I’m not in a hurry, says Chakwera","President Lazarus Chakwera says he is not in a hurry to make public appointments or changes, saying everything needs to be done in an orderly manner and in accordance with the dictates of the law.
In an interview on Tiuzeni Zoona talk show on privately-owned Zodiak Broadcasting station (ZBS) radio, the president also said he was taking into consideration feedback from people; hence, the delays in making some appointments.
Said Chakwera: ‘’If it is about delays in removing and replacing a specific individual, then that is not right in a number of ways. One of it [the reasons] is that we should not appoint someone in contrast to what the law says.
‘’when we are fixing thins or when we are changing positions, there should be tolerance and respect for incumbent position holders so that proper handover are made even when there are issues.’’
The president, who was head of the Malawi Assemblies of God Church before joining front-line politics in2023, said there was need to abolish a culture where a change of regime means disregarding necessary procedures, including handover.
He said he believes that regardless of situations, there should be a proper way of doing things and procedures to be followed.
Chakwera who teamed up with UTM party president and the country’s then estranged Vice-President Saulos Chilima as his running mate in the June 23 fresh presidential elections, said it would not be proper to talk about his intention to stand again in the next election.
He said the focus now should be on how the country would be rebuilt, saying the issue of his candidacy in the next election would be tackled ‘’when we get to that bridge’’.
Chilima is on record as having hinted that the presidency or presidential ticket of Tonse Alliance would be rotational among partner parties.
During yesterday’s interview, Chakwera also started that his relationship with Chilima as his Vice-President will not at any point be complicated, emphasising that their main agenda is to rebuild the country.
Since 1994 when the country adopted a new constitution that created the Office of the Vice-President, the relationship between the president and Veep has often been strained, with the Vice-President been sidelined in the course of the tenure of office.
Reacting to Chakwera’s interview, governance commentator Makhumbo Munthali yesterday said the need to follow procedures and the law was the way to go.
But he said the Tonse Alliance administration should not be too slow to act as time is not on their side because Malawians are eagerly waiting for them to begin fulfilling their manifestos; hence, there is need for human resource to implement the pledges.
On whether Chakwera will represent the nine-party alliance again in the next election, he said that was some thing parties in the alliance may have already agreed upon before signing their agreement.
During the interview, Chakwera also defended his appointments of retired individuals back into the public service, saying they have been recalled to perform specific functions and would not be there for long as stipulated in their respective contracts.
He also backed the arrest of several officials under the ousted Democratic Progressive Party, saying the law is taking its course and not necessarily being selective.
While stressing his commitment to trim presidential powers, Chakwera said Tonse alliance will work strongly to rebuild the country as everyone in the alliance has a role to play.",LLOYD CHITSULO ,National Publications Limited,1

,Atupele faults long – term development ,"Former United Development Front (UDF) president Atupele Muluzi has said Malawi has all it takes to become an upper middle-income economy within 10 years, but what is lacking is good leadership. 
Speaking yesterday at Masintha Ground in Lilongwe where the party was celebrating its 30 years unnivesary, he said 2063 is too far from a projection for the country, which is rich in resources such as gas, oil,water and precious stones that can spur development. 
Said Muluzi; “With good leadership, the country can develop in a very short period. The big problem we have is corruption. Leaders do not think about the nation. They think of how much they will steal with corruption we cannot make progress.” 
He stressed that UDF holds the key to developing this country, “within 10 years, can reach level of Dubai, Kuwait and Qatar. We need to join hands to develop this country, Malawi is a very rich,” said Muluzi.

,"EU, Worlds Bank dismiss Atupele  ","The European Union (EU) and the World Bank yesterday distanced development partners fromremarks by United Democratic Front (UDF) presidential candidate Atupele Muluzi purporting that donors will only resume budget support if there will be regime change in the May 20 Tripartite Elections. Atupele, the youngest of the 12 presidential candidates, told a rally in Mzuzu on Sunday that alongside his running mate Godfrey Chaponda they met representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and other development partners last Friday. He claimed the development partners told opposition leaders they would only support the budget if there is change of government. Said Atupele; “On Friday, Dr Godfrey Chaponda and l met with World Bank, International Monetary Fund [IMF] and Malawi’s donor partners who told us openly that if we don’t change government this year, then will reserve to zero – deficit budget. “Today, the Government of Malawi has already started to put in place zero- deficit budget and you all know what this means, the problem we encountered will come back to haunt us if we continue with this government. They [donors] have told us openly that because of Cashgate, issues of theft and economic mismanagement, they will not inject any money if things don’t change.” But in a written response to a questionnaire from The Nation to authenticate Atupele’s claims, EU head of delegation Alexander Baum said whereas he did not personally listen to Atupele’s address, disbursement of budget support is based on macro – economic stability as assessed by the IMF and the public finance management – related assessments of fiduciary risks. Said Baum; “[The Malawi] government has implemented a number of action, but many actions necessary to fix the public finances are still work in progress. Each partner assesses its fiduciary risks and takes decision on this basis. “There are no political criteria linked to budget support in Malawi other than what we call the ‘fundamental principles ‘, i.e. human rights, democracy etc. There is consequently not a link to a specific government that any colleague from the international partners would have said something different. I hope this clarifies it.” In an earlier interview, Zeria Banda, who is responsible for communications at the World Bank African Regional Office, said when the World Bank met with members, nothing was said regarding elections. She said; “We met with leaders of various political parties, including PP [ People’s Party], MCP [ Malawi Congress Party] and UDF to share our perspectives on the state of the economy and how to sustain reforms for more meaningful economic development. We also discussed agricultural reforms. We did not touch elections or results thereof.” Malawi's national budget is financed 40 percent by donors on the recurrent expenditures and 80 percent on development expenditure. Last November, the country’s major donors under the common Approach to Budget Support (Cabs), to which Baum is to co- chairperson, announced the withholding of $150 million in budget support in protest over plunder of public resources at Capital Hill widely known as Cashgate. Last week, an IMF mission from Washington led by Tsidi Tsikata said the IMF will wait for the election before it releases a $20 million (about K8.4 billion) disbursement into the government purse as part of the Extended Credit Facility programme. Tsikata also said the mission had proposed to return to Lilongwe in June to confirm the recommendation agreed before submitting a report to the IMF management and Executive Board.

10/1/2021,"Malawi, others at risk of widening digital divide","The United Nations says Malawi and other leastdeveloped countries (LDC) are at risk of falling further behind on the use and uptake of digital services as the share of information and communications technology (ICT) imports continues to drop across all regions.
Figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) show that for some time, ICT imports for LCDs and Africa were at 3.5 percent for LCDs and 5.3 percent for Africa.
Unctad says the increases in other regions were larger and the extent to which LCDs and Africa trail other regions in the world is huge.
ICT imports in Asia stood at 28 percent, 16 percent for developed regions and 13 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean.
In a statement, Unctad director of technology and logistics Shamika Sirimanne said the Covid-19 pandemic has made affordable ICT goods imports even more important for countries at early stages of the digital transformation.
These are the same countries that saw the biggest falls in ICT goods imports in 2020.
She said: ""In this context, adopting trade facilitation and customs automation measures to smooth import processes will be important to improve access to the equipment needed in the digital economy.""
Globally, imports of ICT goods grew by 1.1 percent, rising $27 billion to almost $2.5 trillion.
The report further said that the pandemic-related acceleration in digitalisation risks further exacerbating digital divides, with LDCs being left further behind.
""It is now more urgent than ever to ensure that those trailing in digital readiness can catch-up,"" said Unctad in its technical note on the pandemic's impact on trade in the digital economy.
Unctad figures show that in 2020, computers and peripheral equipment overtook communication equipment as the second largest component of ICT imports, after electronic components, for the first time since 2013, increasing by three percent while imports of communication and consumer electronic equipment fell by around 10 percent.
In an interview on Tuesday, ICT Association of Malawi president Bram Fudzulani observed that the demand for ICT services in the country is suppressed by high cost of ICT equipment.
He said: ""We need to revise taxes and fees levied on smartphone devices and Internet for an ordinary Malawian to afford.
""The numbers accessing
ICT are worrying when looking at the largest population with access to Internet and smartphones.""
Through the Malawi Digital Economy Strategy, the Malawi Government targets to increase network access for Internet usage to 80 percent of the population from the current 13.8 percent and increasing device ownership from 51 percent to 80 percent by 2026.
The strategy, which notes that affordability is the largest barrier to uptake of mobile services in Malawi with device costs contributing. significantly to this, says to address the barriers, it will phase out the 10 percent excise on data and text package purchases and phase out Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority's 3.5 percent tax on ICT provider turnover.",Grace Phiri,National Publications Limited,1
,Usi warns errant civil servants ,"Vice – President Michael Usi has warned civil servants  against reporting rate for duties, saying the government will not hesitate to dismiss such employees.  
Speaking in an interview after making a surprise visit at Chikwawa District Council offices and Chikwawa District Hospital yesterday, he said most civil servants report late for duties as they wish, defying the official Malawi Government working hours from 7.30am to 4.30pm. 
Usi said some civil servants’ tendency of reporting for duties late is one of the factors hindering the country’s development. 
He said; “So, this time around, we will go after them [civil servants] and make sure that those that deserve to be booted out; they have been booted out. We need to serve Malawians better.” 
During his visit, Usi expressed satisfaction that Chikwawa district commissioner Nardin Kamba and director of health and social services Grace Momba were executing their duties as they were in office by 7.30am. 
In his remarks Kamba decried low funding, saying it was compromising public service delivery in the district. 
He said; “But as a district, we are trying our best to maximise our local revenue generation. We are working with other partners to fill in the gaps that we have in delivery of public service. 
“One of the examples is we wrote a proposal to EU [ European Union] and they are about to grant us 1 million euro [ about K1,2 billion] to use for environmental management,” 
At Chikwawa District Hospital the Vice – President bumped into a nurse who reported for work at 8am. 
He quizzed her why she was late, and she said she had had a problem with her child. 
Commenting on the Vice – President's move, Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences development scholar Andrew Kaponya and Catholic University of Malawi development studies senior lecturer Justine Mangulama separately said the surprise visit was aligned with Malawi 2063, the country's long – term development strategy which calls for mindset change in pursuit of the aspiration to transform the economy  middle income status. 
But Kaponya said while presence and punctuality is important, the government should ensure that its staff are given necessary resources to execute their tasks. 
Mangulama, on the other hand, urged Usi and senior government ministries, departments and agencies to appreciate the actual situation on the ground. 
He said; “If civil servants know that they can be visited anytime, they will be vigilant, and we can improve the service delivery. 
“But this should also be accompanied by better working conditions. 
This can help to boost the morale of the civil servants.”

Atupele, who has been roped in President Peter Muthalika’s first Cabinet, said in an interview in Lilongwe he is in Cabinet to serve and deliver the transformation agenda to Malawians. On whether he is an opportunist by accepting the post, Atupele, who finished fourth in the presidential Elections, said; “How is this making me an opportunist? You can serve in Cabinet and serve Malawians, just the same way as you can serve any position. “There are some synergies between Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) manifesto and UDF manifesto and we saw this even during the debates, where it was all about exchanging ideas to the cause. “It’s about Malawi, and whatever capacities and positions we serve it’s really about Malawians at heart and this is a necessity to the need for unity of purpose and making sure it’s about Malawi and putting Malawi forward.” Atupele said his Cabinet appointment will not disorient UDF and that he is in consultation with his members. “I think what is important is that this [decision] is about making sure that we deliver our transformation agenda for Malawians and, of course, the consultation process are still underway and will be able to communicate what that process will be,” he said. This is the second time Atupele has accepted a Cabinet posting from a governing party. In 2012, Atipele and several UDF members of Parliament (MPs) were in the first Cabinet hired by former president Joyce Banda of People’s Party (PP). On Monday, UDF sources indicated that after his appointment, Atupele summoned his party’s senior members to a meeting in Lilongwe where he pleaded with them not to disintegrate. Atupele reportedly told his party members that he knew some were against his appointment and his decision could create problems, but he said he needed their support. The sources claimed that there was a minor feud within UDF’s rank and file following Atupele’s appointment to Cabinet. But UDF spokesperson Ken Ndanga yesterday said it is impossible with human nature to make a decision that satisfies every person despite its motives. Said Ndanga; “Our president has not gone in government to serve the interest of any political party, but to serve Malawians regardless of their affiliation, religion, tribe or status in society.

Malawi Congress Party (MCP) president Lazarus Chakwera faces a daunting task to fill the boots left by John Tembo whom many revere as an enlightened and unyielding politician.
Chakwera's job was cut out for him.
According to Parliamentary Standing Orders, the job description of the Leader of Opposition includes ""presenting alternative policies to those of the government"". Still feeling that he was robbed of victory three years after the cut-throat polls, Chakwera has to keep Mutharika's administration in check.
Oftentimes, the ruling party and chiefs that defends its infamous policies still accuse the MCP leader of just criticising government and failing to offer solutions.
""He has never given solutions to problems Malawians are facing. As Leader of Opposition, he was supposed to be giving solutions and not just criticising government,"" says Minister of Information and Communication Technology Nicholas Dausi who speaks for government.

He writes: ""Does this mean we elected robots incapable of formulating solutions? If you tell me my weakness-say for example, you drink too much, in the end, you might lose your job,'-do I need anyone to tell me that the solution is to stop drinking?"" he writes on his Facebook page.

‘’For us as Malawians, we feel this undeniable bond whenever we travel beyond our borders we travel beyond our borders which is why I have never accepted that Malawi is land-locked, but rather land-linked to our Sadc brothers on all sides and a can assure you that we would not have it any other way.
‘’From this perspective, I humbly request you, the in-coming chairman, my brother and neighbour, Your Excellency Filipe Nyusi, to give us all no rest during your tunure until we join hands in honouring the late Benjamin Mkapa by fully liberalising trade across the Sadc religion and unlock the economic possibilities that our peoples dream of.’’

Among the bail conditions was that Mbewe should not make such posts again. In application to have Maele’s bail revoked, the State argued that he has continued making such posts. The State further provided printed screenshots of the posts. But defense lawyer Gilbert Khonyongwa challenged the bail revocation request and made a counter application to dismiss the case, saying the document that the State presented was not primary evidence and therefore, can no be used in court. However, State prosecutor Levinson mangani told the court that the State was ready to demonstrate how the evidence was sourced and that the posts in question exist. In his ruling on the application, SRM Wanagwa Nyirenda said he could not find enough reason to dismiss the case the case as the State was ready to demonstrate how the evidence was obtained. However, he asked the state to make available gadgets that were used to extract the evidence contested by the defense. 
“The  State should make available the gadgets so that the defence can check them,"" said Nyirenda.
The magistrate adjourned the case to Friday when the court will hear the bail revocation application.
Mbele is currently on court bail. He is answering criminal libel and publication of offensive communication charges following his posts on Facebook. ",George Singini,National Publications Limited,1

In written response yesterday, DPP Vice President (South) Kondwani Nankhumwa said much as he would not comment on the matter, Mutharika, 81, needs to come out and clearly state his position. He said; “First, ask APM to come out clear on the matter and express himself That is the only time some of us can comment,”  Convention remains ultimate decider - Msaka.In a separate written response, the party's vice-president (East) Bright Msaka said while there are numerous platforms for electing leadership, a convention remains the ultimate decider. “There are various mobilizations for leadership that take place within a political party. Ultimately, the convention decides, he said. But when contacted yesterday, Mutharika’s spokesperson Shadric Namalomba said the immediate past president is still consulting on the matter and he will state his position in due course.  His Excellency APM is taking note of the ongoing endorsements. He (Mutharika] Is currently consulting and at the right time Malawians will be informed, he said. When asked if the endorsement reflect the party’s position in general, Namalomba said Mutharika believes it is citizens' right and freedom to express themselves as enshrined in Malawi’s Constitution. He said the endorsements also tell a story about Mutharika's  Mutharika's capabilities, hence, those endorsing have trust in him to lead the party during the 2025 general election. In recent months, some DPP top officials have been convincing party followers to allow Mutharika to contest in 2025. DPP regional governor (North) Patrick Ackim Mwanza and his counterpart in the South, Charles Mchacha, told our sister paper Nation on Sunday of May 8, 2022, that they want Mutharika to contest in the forthcoming elections to end squabbles that have rocked the former governing party.

 Namalomba referred the matter back to PAC. In an earlier interview, governance commentator Makhumbo Munthali said if the DPP's constitution will allow Mutharika to contest again, there should be a level playing field so that other aspirants can compete with him without being barred or persecuted.  He said the current attempts where some candidates are not allowed to campaign are a clear signal that the environment is not conducive. Cracks in the DPP came to light in August 2020 when secretary general Greselder Jeffrey told The Nation that there was need for new leadership. Mutharika lost the court-sanctioned June 23, 2020, presidential election to President Lazarus Chakwera.

,Chakwera makes new appointments,"President Lazarus Chakwera yesterday made new appointments to State House and identified the appointees by district of origin, a strategy political analysts have faulted as not necessary.
State House director of communication and executive assistant to the president, Sean Kampondeni, in an interview defended the strategy of identifying which districts the appointees come from.
He said president Chakwera is leading a Tonse Alliance administration and when making appointments, he has to look across the nation.
‘’By disclosing which districts the appointees are coming from, it’s for transparency sake. People have to knoww where the appointees are coming from and if it’s inclusive in nature,’’ said Kampondeni.
But a political scientist at University of Malawi’s Chancellor Collage Mustafa Hussein dismissed Chakwera’s reasoning, arguing people have to be appointed on merit, should have the technical know how and be capable to deliver.
‘’Geographical spreading of positions should not be the first thing, actually what the president wants to do may have ethnicity undertones. While he may have good intentions, people would surely misinterpret this, it’s not necessary to refer appointees to their home of origin,’’ Hussein said.
Humphrey Mvula, another political analyst, said in an interview referring to appointees by districts they come from should not be encouraged.
‘’If people want to find out at some point where appointees are from, they can do that on their own. I understanding the intentions of the President, this is coming after he was widely criticised on how he appointed his Cabinet, but again this is not the way to do,’’ Mvula said.
The political analyst said the Tonse Alliance with Chakwera and his running mate Saulos Chilima, now the vice president, strongly campaigned on the Malawi one nation principle, fearing this new strategy of identifying where appointees come from may defeat this philosophy.
‘’they told Malawians they don’t believe in tribalism or regionalism, we should be getting rid of this, inherently, at an administration level, they should work on it to ensure appointments are not concentrated to two or three districts,’’ he said.
Mvula said the Tonse Alliance team promised during their campaign rallies that they would not be asking people where they come from when making appointments, but said it is clear that the appointing authority of the new appointments had to do a research about which districts the appointees are from, which he said is a bad a thing.
State House yesterday announced appointments of seven individuals to the various positions at the state house, disclosing that they come from Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Zomba, Mzimba, Blantyre, Thyolo and Kasungu districts.
Chakwera appointed Overstone Kondowe as special adviser on people Living with Albinism and Disability and Reverend Brian Kamwendo as special adviser on religions affairs, with Sheikh Hashim Abbas as his deputy.

He said, ‘’if we practice good intra party politics, it means we will also have good politic at national level reflects the practices in the political parties. If things are will in a political party, even government can perform better.
Chakwera said Malawi as a county already has structures to develop, but what is need is a change of the mindset on how politicians behave.

However, the politics I am talking about is policy based which is able to deal with issues,’’ he added.

Outlining his vision for the party, Chakwera said 2014 is the year that MCP would get back into government, but said to achieve that, he needs support from God as well as from both the newly elected executive members and the outgoing national executive committee (NEC) members and the entire party membership.

,Maliwichi converted Usi to drama ,"A minute part of his role at the international NGO. 
They know him more as manganya in the radio and television soap, Tikuferanji. 
Manganya exploits are also evident on the small screen in films like ‘ Dr Manga.’ 
His side-splitting drama in several theatrical acts including an impersonation of Malawi’s first President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, surrounded by his mbumba and in an open Land Rover .  
During the Bingu wa Muthalika regime he also brought the hard hitting ‘Loto la Farao’ and when Peter Muthalika was president, he ignited fire at the Comes Hall in Blantyre with ‘ Ulalikiwu Ngwatonse.’ 
Before his appointment little was said about his education. Very few cared that the man behind Manganya held two masters’ degrees and, in fact, a Doctor of Philosophy. That is not including his professional genesis of medical assistant. 
Much as he walked through the corridors of universities of Bedfordshire and Derby in the United Kingdom, Andrews university in the United States of America and the Malamulo Medical College at home, Usi recalls that it was Mulange secondary School where his interest in drama was ignited.  
In a 2016 interview, Usi paid homage to one teacher at the school who introduced him to drama. 
He said; “It all started with with a Mrs. Malawichi, my English Literature teacher at the school who spotted and motivated me and made me what i am today. Although l need to be quiet, observant had always commenting on issues when they need arose, my teacher saw the acting potential in me.” 
Usi who hails from Golden Village in T/A Chikumbu’s area in the district, recalled that the teacher first featured him as Ikemefuna a character in Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart . ............... first theatre group which was carrying out campaigns against non – communicable diseases, “ said Usi after Usi was sworn in as Veep, society sought out the teacher who directed him into acting. Eve Maliwichi (nee kunkwezu) a retired teacher and former Register of Malawi College of Health Sciences (MCHS) gave out a heavy laugh when when we introduced our subject. She agrred to have given Usi the difficult part during the Literature lesson when he was in form 3. 
 I found his character to be strong. He ws fluent in English. That was just what i needed to bring out Ikemefuna, the beloved child of Okonkwo as compared to Nwoye, a weakling. Dr Usi handled the character so well. I encourage him to join our club or something else,” says the mother of four.  
In 1983, when she joined Musescho, as the school is fondly called by students and the alumni, there was no drama club at the school, unlike her previous posting at Likuni Girls Secondary school. In fact, she was patron of the drama club when the school lifted the coveted Atern drama contest for secondary schools with a play titled ‘The Banana Tree’. But how did she feel that one of her students was now Vise – President of the Republic? Maliwichi laughed, again, and said; “I feel so blessed. As teachers, our students take up great positions. It is a lesson in my my life that even teacher must treat their learners perfectly well. You don’t even know what they will become later in life.” 
Citing Usi’s example Maliwichi feels drama increases one’s chances to progrss in other careers. That, she says, because theatre makes you more ‘industrious and idependent.’ 
She feels Manganya as a character, is strong and avoids laziness and weakness just like Usi. 
“As far as l see, the Manganya character earns respect from those around him in the acts because he doesn't pretend. The scripts flow naturally like water,” she observes. 
For her, drama is a vehicle for transitioning from harmful cultures and educating on social issues, apart from merely entertaining. 
“I encourage students, especially girls to do and join drama. It boosts their self-esteem, public speaking and presentation skills get better with drama. Even as a retired teacher, l always encourages girls to go to school. Sometimes l sees girls in the village being sent from school having failed to pay fees, l assist where l can,” she says. 
Maliwichi's life is an interesting and dramatic ‘plot.’ her past intertwines with the present in a not – so – familiar manner. 
Maliwichi studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Malawi, chancellor College whwre she graduated in 1977 coincidentally, president Chakwera was one of her classmates. 
‘I was taking several units in English, and others in public administration and political science. The President was a classmate in one of the English units l was taking,” she beams. 
Having taught at several secondary schools across the country, an opportunity arose to study for a master’s degree in the United Kingdom and, thereafter , she briefly taught at lilongwe teachers College before being appointed principal of Blantyre Teachers College. 
Since the family and ger husband Harry, an educationist and medical physiologist, was a lecturer at Kamuzu College of Nursing and later Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources resided in Lilongwe then, she decided to retire and join MCHS as college Registrar to be with the family.

12/12/2022, Mithi challenges interdiction over social media posts,"Mzuzu-based social media influencer and civil servant Julius Mithihas challenged the Account General’s decision to suspend hi from duty over his social media posts deemed critical of government and is seeking court redress.
Mithi, who was interdicted last month for writing on social media platforms allegedly castigating government and other senior government officials, works as a senior accounts assistant at the Regional Irrigation and Water Development Office in the Northen Region.
In a letter dated November 25 2022, Accountant General Henry Mphasa accused Mithi of making “unfounded, impolite and discourteous castigations”.
Reads the letter in part: “I write to inform you that these allegations constitute a serious act of misconduct in terms of the Malawi Public Service regulations”
“In view of this and in accordance with the Malawi Public Service Commission regulations 42 (3) as read by regulation  I am prohibiting you from exercising the powers and functions of your office as Senior Accounts Assistant (Grade L) with pay with immediate effect."" Mphasa further ordered Mithi to cease to exercise any power and functions in the civil service and not leave Malawi without written permission from the Accountant General's office.
""Please note that the interdiction order shall remain in force until you are cleared on the charges levelled against you or a decision is reached by the government. This interdiction is intended to pave the way for investigation into allegations levelled against you,"" he said.
But responding to the letter, Mithi through lawyer Davie Lameck requested the Accountant General to immediately lift the interdiction order as it breaches his constitutional right to freedoms and opinion, expression and political rights as enshrined under sections 14,
35 and 40, respectively, of the constitution.
He said: ""Your accusations are void ab initio per Section 5 of the Constitution. It constitutes unfair labour practice and violets his rights to be heard.
""We wish to put it on record that since you have not thus provided
particulars of the allegations against our client, it reasonably means that the said particulars do not exist and any later production of particulars will reasonably be taken as manufacturing of evidence."" The lawyer also reminded the government that civil servants are not excluded in all the provisions of the Constitution.",Precious Kumbani,National Publications Limited,1

,Manganya: Chakwera’s secret weapon? ,"In appointing Michael Usi as the country’s Vice – President after the tragic loss of Saulos Chilima, President Lazarus Chakwera has demonstrated a maturity that the beginning of a transformation are made of. 
The questions of the vice – presidency often emerges from the shadow immediately before general elections. This is when presidential candidates must submit their papers to the Malawi Electoral Commission, a requirement of which is that each aspiring candidate must name a running mate. 
In this period, the choice of vise –presidential candidates becomes a focus of intense speculation and bargaining . I can even remember one contestant who picked his running – mate at a roadside roundabout while on the way to submit his papers. He had no idea was going to be his running – mate until it suddenly come to him at breakfast. Thanks God for sausage and baked beans! 
What makes this hoopla even more intriguing is that in Malawi, just as in many countries around the world, the vice – presidency has always had such a bad reputation. 
In America, for instance, it has been decided for nearly 200 years, especially by those who have held the office. John Adams called it “the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived, or his imagination conceived,” Garner declared with some feeling, that the job was “hardly worth a pitcher of warm spit.”  
The choice of vice – presidential candidate has traditionally been viewed as having more symbolic than substantive significance. Consequently, the selection has typically been made based on political considerations, be they matters of intraparty import ( the desire to propitiate a rival faction) or electoral strategy ( the hope of balancing a ticket in an advantageous way). 
It is a fact that the appointment od Usi cannot bring any of these perceived advantages that makes Chakwera’s choice powerfully mature. As Sherlock Holmes has always sought to teach us, when  you eliminate all the  other possibilities, whenever is left, however improbable, must be your answer. 
Regardless of the many qualities and abilities that the late Chilima brought to the office , the bottom line was always that held the office by virtue of his being the leader of the UTM party. He was a representative of the other block of the alliance. 
The same cannot really be said about Usi. Reports in the media indicate that his continued presence in UTM may be at risk and there are indications to careful observers that the UTM, as party has not necessarily acknowledged a leadership succession from Chilima to Usi. His (Usi) precarious standing cannot be considered as something of value that Chakwera saw in appointing him because there are no political advantages pr any kind of political balancing advantages in the appointment. It must have been made for some other reason. 
But we also know that chakwera appointed Chilima because of professional reasons and for his track- record as a leader and an achiever. These are the very reasons that the president considered and gave us when he justified his appointment as already pointed out – the fact that Chilima was a lot more politically too. 
In this regard, the only possibility that remains is that Chakwera has appointed Usi beacause of professional reasons.he wants a Vise – President who will gelp him achieve what he set out to do, which is to develop this country. 
I can hear you asking : But how can Usi succeed where the very talented Chikuma seemingly failed for three years? After all, was it not Usi himself admited that Chilima’s boots are too large for him to fill? This is a good question. Keep reading .  
Is Chakwera right in producing Usi from his back pocket as his secret weapon? Does Usi now fit this now spotlit bill of Chakwera’s knight in shining ammon? 
The answer is yes and no. Yes, because just like the late Chilima. Usi has a track- record of top service delivery and has pristine leadership qualities. While as Chilima earned his spurs in the private commercial sector, Usi earned his credentials in leading a top international non- governmental organisation, winning many awards for top leadership perfomance in terms 0f experience and the ability that a president can need from his Vice- President in the huge task of leading the nation. Usi  he has as good a pesron as any well educated and well experienced person can be. His crowd – pulling potential as a comedian of some repute in his other life cannot be a bad bonus either! 
No beacuse the vice- presidency is not an easy office from which one can influence the direction of the country. Thus, if the President does not take the lead of empowering and including the wisdom and abilities of the Vice-president, then all the positive will be lost and all that will remain wii be politicking which does not develop the country. 
For Usi to be Chakwera’s secret weapon,and for him to help Chakwera convince those that still doubt his right to the presidency based on their evaluation of his perfomance. It is crucial that the president should regularly consult the Vice- president job depends on the President’s commitment to their relationship. Each hour that the presidents spends in private conference with the vice – president is an hour not to spend with someone else. That is why what the Vice –President can bring to those conservation in the way of knowledge and experience is so important. 
As for the newly appointed Vice – President Usi, my advice is very simple – there are four basic rules for Vice- President to follow to build trust with the president and ensure harmony in the working relationship. 
        (1)  Never complain to the press, establish a channel of communication that is open so that if you are unhappy with something you, can speak freely about it to the president rather than complaining to the media or to party officials who then spread rumours. 
       (2) Never take credit from the president. The Vice- President must constantly be mindful of who is president and who is not. You are not president. All credit must go go to the president. 
       (3) Fall in line. No matter how much the vice – president opposes a presidential decisions  he or she must support the final policy. The Vice – President does not have to become a vocal supporter or lobbyist on the particular issue, but must fall in line like any other staffer. 
       (4) Share the dirty work without complainig. Through the Vice – President may not like endless travel comes with the territory . It is part of being a team player. 
        In the final analysis, although the answer to the question  of whether picking Usi will be moment of triumph or not for President Chakwera depends on himself. If he recognises that it is time to take the Vise- presidency seriously, as a major source and asset that must be included and utilised to the full, then Usi will indeed , be his secret weapon. 
      But iy means that Chakwera will be the first president ever in this country to make a determined effort to find and then utilise talented and seasoned Vice- President who can help to make their administrations more effective, and then empower them to do so. ",,National Publications Limited,1

,Atupele seeks return to UDF ,"Two years after announcing his departure from active politics and subsequently relinquishing the United Democratic Front (UDF) presidency, former president Bakili Muluzi’s son, Atupele has expressed interest to vie for the post. 
On the other hand, UDF interim president Lilian Patel has said she will not contest for any position at the party’s convention slated for August 3 2024 ahead of the September 16 2024 General Elections. 
UDF spokesperson Yusuf Mwawa in an interview last week said Atupele is among the UDF members who have already collected nomination forms. 
But he refused to disclose names of the other hopefuls, saying the party will give more information during a media briefing in Blantyre on a date to be set. 
Said Mwawa; “The nominations were opened last month (June) and will be closed on 17th of July before the convention on August 3. honourable Atupele Muluzi will stand for the presidency. 
“Our constitution is open – ended and does not give a time period for one to hold a particular position in the party.” 
Atupele could not be drawn on the development as he did not respond to The Nation phone calls. 
Patel, on the other, in an interview on Thursday said she will not contest for any position in the party as she would like to focus her energy on retaining her Mangochi South parliamentary seat. 
She said she has sarved UDF in various positions since 1993 and felt it is time to give others a chance to run the affairs. 
“But if the party wish to give me something honorary, that is okay. Otherwise, i am not contesting . But i am available for any advise or service they (UDF) want from me, ""said Patel.  
Commenting on the matter, political analyst Chimwemwe Kandodo, Nandin Patel and Victor Chipofya, a lecturer at Blantyre Internationa University noted that Atupele has the right to contest for the UDF presidency. 
However, the observed that his return has both positive and Negative sides. 
Said Kandodo, a lecturer at Catholic University of Malawi; “Sometimes it can bring confusion because for the past two years, he hasn’t been around as UDF president and Madam Patel was acting as the president. 
“So together with her team, maybe she had put in place other strategies in order to win in the next year’s general elections, and now that Atupele wants to come back won’t it disturb the strategy?” 
On her part, Nandin Patel, a member of Political science Association, said Atupele has the quality and capabilities of a leader, but needed to prove his consistency. 
“Let’s hope that there will be competition for the president at the convention,” she said . 
Atupele has led UDF in two presidential elections, first in 2014 and in the nullified 2019 vote. In the June 23 2020 court sactioned fresh presidential election, he featured as running mate to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president Peter Muthalika. 
However, the pair lost to a combination of incumbent President Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi Cogress Party who have teamed up with former UTM party president and the country’s vice – president Saulos Chilima. 
In his resignation letter to UDF secretary general Kandi Padambo dated May 28 2022, Atupele said he was “going into business for the development and progress of Malawi”.

,"UDF disowns freiends of Atupele, calls group illegal. ","A parallel strucure has emerged in the aestwhile governing United Democratic Front (UDF) following the resurfacing on the political front of its former president Atupele Muluzi. The Party’s secretary general Kandi Padambo said in an interview on Wedsnday the party is aware of the parallel structure, which is calling itself friends of Atupele Muluzi.  The grouping is campaigning for the party’s former leader to contest in the 2025 Election on the party’s ticket without being sanctioned. Before resurfacing, Atupele, who is the son to the party’s founder Bakili Muluzi, resigned on May 20 2022 as UDF president to transition into a pan – African business executive. The parallel group has been holding meeting across the country and campaigning for Atupele, describing him as a clean and honest politician without any involvement in corruption- related scandals. When contacted yesterday, Atupele confirmed that they are people who would like him to serve. He said; “I am listening to the discussion with keen interest. However, what l must point out is that Atupele is a team player, I am not a divider but unifier.” Atupele said he was willing to serve the country as the country is going through the great pain. “My message is a message of hope for Malawians that a new nation will come out of this pain. However, it will have to take some sacrifices and bold decisions. “We are at a time that requires more statesmen and women who can rise above divisive party politics in service of our nation. We need a reset button for a new Malawi,” he said. Atupele said he is willing to serve in any capacity, as a servant of the people of Malawi. “If the nation calls me to serve l am willing to serve, whether as a street sweeper or a president. It is a service.” However, Padambo said the grouping is illegal. He said; “The group [Friends of Atupele Muluzi] can make those calls, l am sure it’s their right to do so. But when Right Honourable Atupele Muluzi decides to contest, he will have to abide by the rules and procedures of the party. “He will not contest because the grouping of Friends of Atupele Muluzi is making calls for him to contest but because he remains a member of the party, and he will follow procedures that are in place for any member to contest for any position in the party.” Atupele announced his resignation in a Facebook post on May 30, 2022, in which he said he is embarking on an industrial and economic revolution together with his business partners. Governance expert Boniface Chibwana said in a separate interview. Atupele is likely to retain UDF presidency due to the founder syndrome. “The founder syndrome is also associated with the financial muscle of the individuals and families that are founded those political parties and some supporters align themselves to that family or individuals. This is what is happening in the UDF,” he said. UDF was the first political party to form government after Malawi returned to multiparty democracy in 1994. But its popularity started to decline, especially after the 2004 General Elections when former president Bingu wa Muthalika left the party to form Democratic Progressive party. Apart from popularity, its parliamentary seats have also been on the decline since 1999 in 2014, it got 10 seats. ",,National Publications Limited,1

But Singh in an interview at the weekend said Muluzi was taking advantage of people’s suffering to campaign. She said Muluzi should have made the donation long time ago if he was concerned about drug shortage in hospitals. “You do not campaign when people are suffering . The problems have been there for a long time. He should also have made the donations silently and not going on the podium so that people know he has made a donation. This also goes to every politician even the President [Joyce Banda]. 
She should  not be allowed to donate cows, house, ambulances and so on during the campaign time because those are handouts,” she said. However, Muluzi said he was touched by problems people are facing in hospitals and that doctors are contributing money for patients’ medication. He said by donating, he was setting an example to others. However, Chancellor College associate professor of political science Dr Blessings Chinsinga treated Muluzi’s donation as handouts during elections which would affect free and fair elections.

In his address, Mutharika urged the victims not to lose hope, but keep praying to God. He said: ""When God does something He does for a reason, so let us not despair. He gave us and he has taken. However, Mutharika attributed the calamity to lack of a National Disaster Policy which he said his administration already approved in 2019. The former president, who was accompanied by several party officials, further urged fellow politicians to desist from politicizing the disaster, saying “this is sombre period and let us focus on how best we can help these people” Ironically, Mutharika immediately contradicted his call when he turned his visit into a mini political rally reminding the people in Ndirande that they stoned him during campaign for the court-sanctioned fresh presidential election on June 23, 2020, which he lost.

,UDF says no pact with DPP ,"Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) says the appointment if its president Atupele Muluzi into President Peter Mutharika’s Cabinet does not translate into a working alliance with the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Mutharika appointed Atupele, who was one of the 12 presidential candidate in the May 20 Tripartite Elections, as Minister of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining at midnight on Sunday to complete his promised 20 – members Cabinet. But UDF secretary general Kandi Padambo, in an interview with The Nation yesterday, said the appointment has not changed his party’s status as it remains un the opposition bloc. Said Padambo; “As a party, we have not gone into any political alliance with DPP. The appointment of our president does not change our stand and does not make UDF cease to be an opposition party. We will continue discharging our duties as an opposition party to the expectation of all Malawians.” He said as an opposition party, UDF will continue opposing all laws and policies that are not in the best interest of the majority of Malawians. However, Padambo paid his party will support all policies DPP and its administration will come up with a long as Malawians do not have problems with them. He said; “As a party, we have made our position clear that we will remain a responsible party inside and outside Parliament. The fact that our president has joined government will not compromise our position.” On whether the party does not think DPP was merely after using its president to increase its numerical strength in Parliament, Padambo said; “We think the appointment is in good faith, but if somewhere along the way we see it is not sustainable, we will see what to do then.” Muluzi was also among the first Cabinet ministers appointed by former president Joyce Banda when she ascended to the presidency in line with constitutional order in April 2012 following the death of president Bingu wa Mutharika. However, a few months later, Atupele quit following what Padambo described as misunderstandings between UDF and Banda’s People’s Party (PP) on issues to do with Government of National Unity (GNU). “Last time, we wanted to help, and we thought the Government of National of National Unity (GNU) would be in the best interests of all the parties, but he resigned because certain developments turned out which we thought were not in the best interests of the party as well as Malawians, “ Padambo said. Meanwhile, as we went to press, the UDF executive committee was meeting to discuss the recent developments, which some members said they only heard about from the radio.

,ACB to quiz on Sattar – linked plots ,"The Anti – Corruption Bureau (ACB) has summoned former minister of Land Atupele Muluzi for the questioning over the allocation of some plots in Lilongwe linked to United Kingdom – based businessperson Zuneth Sattar.According to a notice from ACB director general Martha Chizuma dated November 9, Atupele, who served in the ministry from 2015 to 2017 during the Peter Muthalika administration, will appear at ACB head office in Lilongwe today.

In an interview yesterday, Atupele, Son to former president Bakili Muluzi, confirmed being summoned, but feigned ignorance of the details of the ACB investigation. He said; “The only details l gave received are the ones on the summons. You may wish to contact the ACB for further details.” But writing on his Facebook wall, Atupele pledged to avail himself to the ACB for questioning to aid the bureau in its investigations. He wrote; “As a firm believer in the rule of law and due process, of the law, l take this a routine process of the work of the bureau and no cause for worry for me or my supporters as all things become clear after the process.”In its December 23 2021 restriction notice, ACB stopped the ministry of lands from dealing with properties which it believed Sattar, who is under probe over some procurement contracts with Malawi Government ministries, departments and agencies, has beneficial interest. The restriction order reads in part; “The restriction notice has been issued as part of investigation by the bureau following allegations that Zuneth Sattar and his agent Ashok Kumar Sreedharan aka Ashok Nair have been giving bribes to politically exposed persons with the aim of influencing Various Malawi Government Departments to corruptly award contracts to companies belonging to Zuneth Sattar.” On whether he knew that the plots were linked to Sattar, Atupele said, “No, i am not aware.[I have ] no idea about the facts. Will wait to hear tomorrow [today],” ACB principal public relation officer Egritta Ndala yesterday refused to comment the  matter, saying, they do not make such summons public. On December 31 2021, another former minister of Lands Kezzie Msukwa was arrested alongside Nair on corruption allegations relating the land deals with Sattar, but the ACB is awaiting the determination of the Malawi Supreme Court of Appeal to move with the case. The supreme Court is expected to determine on  the admissibility of the foreign obtained evidence.

14/01/2022,State wants Mbele's freedom of expression restricted," State says if social media activist Joshua Mbele is to be granted bail his freedom expression, especially posting on social media on anything to do with his case or material that has potential to damage other people's reputation must be restricted.
Mbele, who was arrested on Tuesday this week, appeared before senior resident magistrate Wanangwa Chirwa in Lilongwe yesterday for bail application whose ruling was reserved for today. He is answering to two counts, criminal libel contrary to Section 200 of the Penal Code and publication of offensive communication contrary to Section 87 of the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act.The offences are in relation to Mbele's Facebook post on January 10 this year where he alleged that Malawi Defence Force Commander   General Vincent Nundwe corruptly benefitted the sum of K4 billion from deals with Zuneth Sattar, who is currently under investigation by both United Kingdom and Malawian authorities.
Mbele, yesterday, pleaded not guilty to both counts, but he could not be granted bail after the State asked the court to restrict him from making any comments or posting on social media anything to do with the case or any other matter that potentially damages the character of someone.
State prosecutor Levision Mangani said they did not object to Mbele's bail so long the State imposes restrictions which include stopping him from publishing any material which affects the reputation of others.
However, defence lawver Gilbert Khonyongwa argued against the restriction, saying freedom of expression is a constitutionally enshrined right which can only be limited after meeting a certain threshold, which he thinks the State has not been able to meet.
Mangani said he understands the said threshold on limitation of rights, but said theirs was not for a lifetime rather only limited to the period of trial.
""The court has the powers to order such limitations. This is in the same way that the courts, as part of bail conditions, have restricted some people's or suspects movements,"" he argued.
Mbele has been in custody since Tuesday and hearing for bail is expected to continue this morning.

Smart Africa Alliance director Lacina Kong said the alliance has in the last 10 years grown its capital from $600 000 to $23 million besides increasing its embership. “Our 10 years journey has bee marked by strong and meaningful multi-stakeholders’ collaboration ad partnerships through practical projects and initiatives, with one shared vision: Accelerating the creation of a single digital market by 2030,” he said, adding that they have also grown partnerships with funding institutions such as European Union, the World Bank and African Development Bank. Minister of Information and Digitisation Moses Kunyuku said in an interview Malawi has joined the alliance this year and hopes to benefit from other countries and players in digitisation agenda. He said : “We have prioritized issues of digitisation because we know that this is what will help to grow our economy.” The transform Africa Summit is an initiative for Smart Africa Alliiance, a network of 36 African countries and other private players aimed at promoting Africa’s digital agenda. It was launched in 2013 in Rwanda seven member States before growing to 36 and MAlawi is a new catch. The summit, which ends this Friday, is the sixth since the launch.

MARCH 29 2020,DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY (DPP) PUBLIC STATEMENT OUR SERIOUS CONCERN WITH AN INCREASE IN MCP VIOLENCE AND REIGN OF TERROR,"For Immediate Release 29TH March, 2020 (Lilongwe) INTRODUCTION The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is deeply concerned with a recent spate and increase in the violence and terror perpetrated by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and its agents. The new wave of terror has been gripped the Central Region where people in the districts of Lilongwe and Dedza are experiencing untold suffering and macabre attacks. We have issued this statement to condemn such violence. CONTEXT These sad events, recent attacks and terror activities, are targeting our DPP governors and DPP leaders in various villages across Lilongwe and Dedza. We have received reports that DPP supporters are living in fear and some have abandoned their homes, they have fled their villages, and are currently in hiding.  We have also received sad reports where groups of people that were holding meetings over MEDF loans were attacked and dispersed by the MCP and its hooligans. Some of these innocent people who were discussing MEDF loans are Malawians from the villages that are in the vicinity of MCP leader Lazarus Chakweras constituency in Lilongwe rural. They are innocent women, youths and men who were in search for economic empowerment to improve their lives and alleviate their poverty through the loans.  Some of these people who are attacked are not even DPP supporters. They are mere villagers since the MEDF loans are benefiting all deserving Malawians without regard to political affiliation. Unfortunately, MCP has in its usual style of using violence and terror, disturbed the economic prospects and has dashed the hopes for these innocent Malawians. MCP RECORD OF HISTORICAL VIOLENCE The DPP continues to register our profound concern with the record of violence that has become the identity of MCP as a party of darkness. History will never be erased as Malawians shall always remember MCP as a party of death. The Mwanza murders will never be forgotten. The death of Attati Mpakati, Mkwapatira Mhango, Chisiza and Orton Chirwa are all part of MCPs historical legacy as a party of death.  Many Malawians were fed to crocodiles. Many lost their jobs, they parted with their families, and hundreds languished in exile because of MCP. A whole village of Che-Moto in Mangochi was burnt down under MCP. The party never respected human rights. Members of Jehovas Witnesses suffered and many had their properties including houses seized. The MCP sent teachers from the Northern Region back to their districts in 1988.  Special prisons were built such as Mikuyu in Zomba where people like Sam Mpasu, Edge Kanyongolo and Jack Mapanje were incarcerated for months and years. Sadly, during the Referendum of 1993, the MCP voted against change. They rejected multiparty. They said NO to democracy. The MCP even planned to kill Catholic Bishops. But the majority of Malawians defeated the MCP and they chose democracy. Malawians chose peace and stability. They rejected darkness and we chose development. MCP AND MODERN DAY VIOLENCE We note with sadness that the MCP has not changed. We in the DPP hereby and urgently call upon all Malawians of goodwill to rise and protect our constitutional democracy. The MCP has not transformed. Our nation has been infiltrated with actors that are masquerading as democratic actors yet they are bent on demolishing the very foundations on which our hard worn democracy was built. The MCP is on the forefront leading this crusade of terror. We wish to repeat what we said a few weeks ago that we have recently observed the systematic collusion between Chilima and MCP who have hijacked the HRDC platform and have turned themselves into a three-some axis of evil. As the DPP, we will not tire, we will not relent, we will not be cowed down, and we will not give an inch of space for this axis of evil to overthrow our constitutional democracy. MCP is a misfit in our modern day democracy. They are continuing with their legacy and identity of terror. MCP has turned some few Nsundwe residents into modern day hitmen and agents of violence. We will not forget how a precious life of a police man was cut shot in Msundwe under the watch of the MCP leaders and Lazarus Chakwera. We will not forget how MCP and its agents have burned peoples houses, looted shops, demolished schools and set on fire police stations, all in the name of demonstrations.  Today, the Central Region is bleeding because of MCP. Parts of the Northern Region are also suffering from the joint terror operations under MCP-UTM and using the HRDC platform. We in the DPP will not get tired and we will condemn these undemocratic behaviours. DPP is a peaceful institution. We do not tolerate anarchy. We believe in development. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the DPP will ensure to protect our members from these attacks. The DPP wishes to assure all our supporters in the Central Region and in all regions of Malawi that we will protect you. We have put in place special measures, which we will not reveal the details here for obvious reasons. These measures are designed to ensure your safety. We have already linked up with law enforcement agencies to bring to book all the perpetrators of this violence, and we look forward to the arrests of these evil minded persons.  We wish to strongly warn and caution the MCP. Enough is enough. This time around, you will not succeed in your plans to cause chaos. We will hold you accountable and we will use all constitutionally acceptable means to block your evil plans. As the DPP, we will defend the Constitution. Violence and terror will never defeat democracy and development; darkness will never conquer light. Lastly, the DPP observes that Coronavirus (Covid-19) continues to wreak havoc in many countries. Since Malawi is not an island, we are bound to be affected in one way or the other. We therefore call upon all Malawians to follow the health guidelines and advice provided by His Excellency the State President Prof. Arthur Peter Mutharika. We urge all Malawians to adhere to the measures issued by the government. In addition, the DPP strongly warns the MCP and UTM to stop politicising the coronavirus.  We wish to admonish MCP that instead of fighting Coronavirus, MCP is busy fighting people. Instead of joining hands to fight Covid-19, MCP is busy unleashing terror on innocent villagers who simply want to receive MEDF loans in the Central Region. We will not leave you to succeed with your barbaric actions. DPP will protect development. DPP will protect Malawi. DPP! We are Unstoppable DPP! We are Unbreakable DPP! We are Unshakable DPP! We stand for Constitutionalism; We Stand for Development, Justice, and Security! Thank You, and God Bless Malawi.

MARCH 29 2020,JUNIOR MDF OFFICERS GET FULL SALARIES WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS,"Opposition attempts to mudslide new Army General flops The MCP/UTM desperate attempt to fight the new Army Commander and creating tension within Malawi Defence Forces has failed with information emerging that no junior officer in the MDF has his or her salary deducted, Cables can confirm.

As our duty is to investigate and provide this nation with correct information, Cables through its operatives in 1 MR, 2 MR, 3 MR, 4 MR, 5 MR, 6 MR and other military formations have established that all is well within MDF and no officer in the other ranks has suffered a salary decrease without any explanation in an attempt to loot funds to fund DPP campaign as alleged by opposition.

According to information gathered by the Cables, Malawi Congress Party and UTM are aware that DPP is fond of using unconventional campaign tactics and as an attempt to stop them they have resorted to creating fear on the people in the two regions so that DPP officials must not be able to carry out underground campaign operations as doing that will expose the operatives who will be suspected as blood suckers.

MARCH 27 2020,CABLES EDITORIAL COMMENT. BRAVO MALAWIANS FOR SNUBBING THESE POWER HUNGRY OPPOSITION POLITICIANS,"Greedy politicians are those that won't mind destroying their own country as long as they get what they want. A few days ago opposition political parties UTM and Malawi Congress Party in their quest to bring the DPP government on its knees held a joint press briefing where they communicated a number of strategies they have put in place to force MEC Chair Jane Ansah and all the commissioners to resign after president Mutharika threw to the dustbin a recommendation from the Public Appointments Committee of parliament to fire them. One of the strategies that was communicated during the press briefing was telling Malawians to abscond from work on Friday the 27th March 2020. Cometh the day and Malawians said no. They stood by principles of patriotism and reported for work. Bravo! Cables therefore condemn the opposition for making irrational decisions that can destroy the only country we call home. It's refreshing to note that Malawians chose their country by not listening to the desperate opposition parties. On Friday March 27th 2020, Malawians woke up early and went on to their daily chores. If this is not a middle finger to the opposition then what is? Cables are even more pleased to see pictures of opposition supporters in their offices, a sign that for once they opted for their country and not cheap politics as promoted by these desperate opposition parties. Cables therefore part Malawians at the back for doing the right thing today. Let's always remember and stand by these three important pillars of development; patriotism, hardwork and integrity.

According to information we have gathered, those that are set to dump the alliance include former state Vice President and Freedom party President Khumbo Kachali, Halima Daudi, Khumbize Chiponda and Ken Kandodo among others. Cables have it on higher authority that about 10 Members of Parliament for MCP from across the country have also shown interest in dumping the alliance saying it lacks leadership, vision, tolerance and zeal to serve Malawians. We can further reveal that meetings have been taking place championed by Harry Mkandawire and Kachali on their next move before the fresh elections. It is not yet known why prominent figures are dumping the MCP and UTM alliance barely days after they signed their agreement.

MARCH 18 2020,"MCP PLANS TO ASSASSINATE VP CHILIMA USING RSA MAFIOSO; CHAKWERA ""NOT AWARE OF THE PLOT"". ","Cables can exclusively reveal that Malawi Congress Party operatives have resurrected plans to assassinate Vice President Saulos Chilima, saying his political stamina is affecting their popularity and votes, Cables can reveal. According to information in our possession, prior to the May 21 polls in 2019, MCP operatives led by Secretary General Eisenhower Mkaka and South Africa based business magnate Simbi Phiri identified a team of hitmen from South Africa, who were paid handsomely to terminate Chilima and heap the blame on the ruling DPP. They raised serious concerns that the coming of UTM was a challenge to MCP therefore affecting their chances of winning the 2019 elections. However, this plan was hatched without the blessings of MCP President Lazarus Chakwera who later after knowing of the plan instructed his boys to drop it. The plan was therefore botched only to be resurrected after MCP lost the election claiming Chilima is the reason MCP lost. Now with squabbles in the MCP and UTM alliance as to who will lead their coalition, Mkaka and Simbi Phiri are back with their evil plans.

Their crime; they wanted to donate the items at Bwaila hospital in Lilongwe to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

Cables have no problem with Malawians who have ideas that can assist in the fight against COVID-19, however, the manner in which Chilima is bringing his prepositions leaves a lot to be desired. A real Vice President of the Republic would simply deploy a memo to the President of the Republic making proposals to him on issues of national importance.  Going in public simply means he does not mean what he says. He is simply politicking, cheaply. The President is in Blantyre and he is working there. A vice president should not dictate where the president should be. What is his motive?  A vice president who does not understand his role and government protocol is a dangerous wild specie. In all this presser he is simply trying hard in vain to outdo his boss, the president. A vice president is but a vice president. He can't be making orders on fuel prices, where the president should be and how ministers should operate. These are state matters and and not some beer party at Mudi House. This is is not basketball but serious matters of the state. The president has already laid out his strategy on COVID-19 fight and development partners like International Monitory Fund (IMF) have already responded to it by pumping in over $100million. While the President is busy monitoring on implementation of the orders he made, Cables have it in authority that he is also working on more measures to help us all fight the pandemic. Lastly, Cables would like to remind Chilima that he is just a vice president and his mandate doesn't go beyond advising the president on matters of national interest.

CHAKWERA MUST APOLOGIZE FOR INCITING MOB JUSTICE.,"A few a days after Malawi Congress Party president Lazarus Chakwera urged his followers across the country to form security groups,there have been a number of reported mob Justice cases where people suspected to be buying national identity cards and blood sucking have been killed and their motor vehicles burnt. A man of Chakwera's caribre who has been a pastor and a president for Malawi Assemblies of God church for over two decades must have respect for sanctity of life. This is not the first time Mr Chakwera has gone that far. Immediately after results of the 2019 elections were announced and not in his favour, he incited his supporters to shed blood. True to his declaration, we saw a wave of killings, maiming, looting, destruction across Malawi through his surrogate son Mtambo. In a democratic dispensation,mob Justice is unacceptable because no person is guilty until proven so by a  court of law. Mr Chakwera must understand that when Malawians were busy fighting for Democracy,Malawi Congress party an entity he is a president today was preaching against it. Malawians can not make a mistake of reverting to one party rule where orders of Malawi Congress party officials were above the law. Chakwera must know that Malawi is not a church congregation who will just say Amen to whatever he says.  Cables have seen how an old woman in Ntchisi had her house demolished,all her belongings burnt because she was a leading a group of fellow small holder business women to get access to madef loans. Cables are aware of a man who lose his life when the money set him ablaze for being suspected that he was buying national identity cards. Cables are aware of two Lilongwe city council employees who were assaulted in the line of duty for being suspected of being sent by Democratic Progressive Party to buy national identity cards. Reverends are supposed to be men who respect the law and rights of others. Men of God as reverends are fondly called are supposed to lead an example in promoting peace in their country and communities but Mr Chakwera seems to be in his own league doing vice versa. Cables are urging Mr Chakwera to withdraw his statement and apologise to the nation for promoting lawless. Lastly,cables urges the authorities not to just watch as greedy politicians are promoting lawless in the name of democracy.
